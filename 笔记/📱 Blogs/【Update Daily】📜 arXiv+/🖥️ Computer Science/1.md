### Summary

This paper proposes a <span style="background:rgba(252, 163, 180, 0.55)">five - dimensional audit framework</span> for evaluating the performance of generative AI models in <span style="background:rgba(252, 163, 180, 0.55)">ethical reasoning</span>, and conducts a systematic analysis of seven mainstream large language models (LLMs). The research focuses on the decision - making logic, explanation quality, and consistency of the models in complex ethical dilemmas, revealing the key challenges and potential improvement directions in current AI ethics evaluation.

### Research Background and Motivation

- **Question**: The application of generative AI (such as ChatGPT) has surged in high - risk fields (such as healthcare and justice), but there is a lack of systematic evaluation criteria for its ethical reasoning ability.

- **Shortcomings of existing benchmarks**: Traditional benchmarks (such as GLUE, MMLU) focus on knowledge or task performance. However, ethical logic evaluation is difficult to apply directly due to the lack of "correct answers" and its cultural sensitivity.

- **Research objective**: Develop a multi - dimensional audit framework to analyze the ethical decision - making process of models and compare the advantages and disadvantages of different models.

### Methodology

**Five - Dimensional Audit Framework**:

1. Analytical Quality (logical rigor, argumentative support)
2. Breadth of Ethical Considerations (inclusion of multiple stakeholders, cultural factors)
3. Depth of Explanation (analysis of root causes and long - term impacts)
4. Consistency (stability of decisions upon repeated inquiries)
5. Decisiveness (ability to make clear decisions in complex situations)
