- [Learn About Electronics](https://www.learnabout-electronics.org/): It provides basic and advanced knowledge of e-learning, including **Semiconductors, Amplifiers, Oscillators, Power Supplies**, etc. The most surprising thing is that almost all materials are available in PDF downloads, making it easy for readers to learn by themselves after downloading.

- [Electronics Lab](https://www.electronics-lab.com/): Not only open source many electronic circuit design examples, including basic circuits, analog circuits, digital circuits, etc., but also provide a wealth of learning resources (articles) in <https://www.electronics-lab.com/articles>

- [Microchip](https://developerhelp.microchip.com/) : This is Microchip's **official developer** help website. It provides a large number of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">data sheets, application notes, reference manuals</span>, etc. for electronic components. It is an important reference website for learning Microchip products. Of course, learning materials related to analog circuits and digital circuits can also be found here.

- [Analog Devices](https://wiki.analog.com/university/courses/tutorials/index) : The official Wiki website of Analog Devices provides a large amount of electronic learning materials, including Analog Electronics, Mixed Signal Electronics (Systems), Signals and Systems, and some e-books in PDF. It is an excellent website for learning analog circuits.

- [All About Circuits](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/) : It provides a wealth of electronic circuits and tutorials, as well as a large collection of analog circuit design references.

- [Electornics Tutorials](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/) : Provides abundant e-learning materials, including Transistors, Amplifiers, Diodes, Filters, etc., and also provides many practical tools for electronic engineers, such as online resistance-inductance-capacitance calculators.

- <https://cppsim.com/circuit_lectures.html> : Lectures provided by CppSim (System Simulator), including Analysis and Design of Analog ICs, Basic Communication Principles, Phase-Locked Loops and their Applications, High Speed Communication Circuits and Systems, and Other Presentations. It is worth mentioning that all lectures are in PDF (slides) format and are of high quality, suitable for electronic engineers to learn and refer to.

- [Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuits](https://cppsim.com/circuit_lectures.html): One of the Lectures provided by CppSim (System Simulator)
