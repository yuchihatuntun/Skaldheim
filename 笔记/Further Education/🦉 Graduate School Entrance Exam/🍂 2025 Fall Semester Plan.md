### Mathematics II

Since I still have coursework to complete and exams to prepare for, I have decided to use this term to build a solid foundation in this challenging subject.

#### Postgraduate English

Given the advice found online, I will focus primarily on vocabulary building during this relatively relaxed period.

I’ll study 100 words per set, and by the time we approach the end of the semester, I should have covered nearly the entire vocabulary book once.
