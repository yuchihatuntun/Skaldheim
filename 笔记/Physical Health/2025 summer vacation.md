### Purpose

My goal is to lose as much weight as possible from 89 kg to 85 kg, mainly through a combination of dieting and aerobic exercise.

### Planning

#### Aerobic exercise

At home, I mainly rely on exercise bikes for physical exercise, and later (starting around July 28) I also started running.

At home, I mainly use two 4kg dumbbells for exercise.

### Result & **Debrief**​

In the end, I finished this sweltering summer weighing <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 255, 255)">89.5</span> kilograms.

I've done some reflection. 

First, it's impossible for me to maintain the same strict control over my diet at home as I did at school. The traditional diet of Northeast China—breakfasts of baked cakes and fried dough sticks, and the habit of eating until very full at both lunch and dinner—makes it difficult to stick to my regular eating routine (especially with my grandmother constantly watching me eat). 

Second, the research workload this break is quite heavy. I have to replicate an open-source project daily, familiarize myself with the code, present it to my senior and advisor, and read endless ArXiv papers, which has led to some stress-related weight gain. 

Third, my physical activity is simply insufficient—a round trip from Haxi Station to my home is only 6 km, and there are no suitable running routes nearby.
