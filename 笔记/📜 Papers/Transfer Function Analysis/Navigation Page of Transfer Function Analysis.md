### Intro
Transfer function analysis is a critical component in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">analog circuits</span>, characterized by diverse methodologies and sophisticated techniques. Over a century of development, it has yielded numerous classical analytical approaches and methods. For instance:

- **Miller's Theorem**

- A wide variety of **TC method** (time constant method).

- Middlebrook's **EET** (extra element theorem) and its derived TEET and NEET (Two/N Extra Element Theorem)

- Hajimiri's **TTC** (time and transfer constants method, time transfer constants method)

We will provide relevant reference materials for Transfer Function Analysis here, as well as summaries and thoughts after reading and learning Transfer Function Analysis Techniques.
