According to the test format of CET-6, I will prepare for the test from vocabulary, listening, reading, writing and translation.

### Current foundation (25-05-16) 

- Vocabulary has only been reviewed once, and needs to be systematically strengthened; 

- the remaining time is limited, and the four modules of listening, reading, writing, and translation need to be efficiently broken through.

- The following plan is designed based on my time urgency and target score, and is divided into three stages: <span style="background:rgba(252, 163, 180, 0.55)">vocabulary consolidation</span>, <span style="background:rgba(252, 163, 180, 0.55)">module-specific breakthrough</span>, and <span style="background:rgba(252, 163, 180, 0.55)">full-scale simulation sprint</span>. 

The recommended study time per day is 6-8 hours, which can be adjusted according to personal circumstances.

### Preparaton Plan

#### Vocabulary reinforcement (May 16-May 23, 7 days)

##### Focus

High-frequency word <span style="background:rgba(252, 163, 180, 0.55)">shorthand</span> + real test vocabulary accumulation

##### Daily tasks

**High-frequency word shorthand:** memorize **260** core high-frequency words every day, focusing on pronunciation, collocation and real test examples.

**Review method:** Use the **Ebbinghaus memory method**, review once in the morning and evening.

#### Module-specific breakthrough (May 16-June 7, 23 days)

##### Daily time allocation

- **Morning** : Listening + Reading

- **Afternoon** : Writing + Translation

- **Evening** : Review of wrong questions of the day + vocabulary review

##### Listening

**Goal**: Listening score of 35% must reach **230+**

**Intensive listening training:**

One set of real test listening every day (after 2016):

1. Do the questions in the first time;

2. Dictate sentence by sentence and analyze the wrong questions in the second time;

3. Summarize the connected reading and transition words (such as however, but) by comparing with the original text in the third time.

Focus on breakthroughs in <span style="background:rgba(252, 163, 180, 0.55)">lectures/speech</span> (10 questions), pay attention to the opening and closing sentences and details such as numbers and time.

**Extensive listening assistance:** listen to BBC news/TED speeches in fragmented time to adapt to different accents and speaking speeds.

##### Reading (1.5 hours per day)

**Goal:** Reading score of 35% must reach **240+**

**Question type:**

Word selection and filling in the blanks: First mark the part of speech, and then eliminate interference items based on contextual logic (accounting for 10 questions).

Long passage matching: First read the question stem and mark the key words (name, place, number), then quickly scan the first and last sentences of the paragraph to locate.

**Careful reading:** Time limit 8 minutes per article, first read the question stem and then go back to the original text to find synonyms, pay attention to attitude words (such as critical, supportive).

Real question training: Complete 1 set of real reading questions within a time limit every day, classify wrong questions (such as detail questions, reasoning questions) and summarize the traps.

##### Writing (1 hour per day)

Goal: Writing score of 15% must reach 95+

Template accumulation:
Recite 3 types of high-frequency templates (phenomenon analysis, viewpoint comparison, problem solving), and accumulate universal sentence patterns (such as "It is undeniable that..."). Write 2 essays from real exam questions every week, correct grammatical errors by comparing with model essays, and replace low-level vocabulary with high-level expressions (such as important→crucial).
​​Structural optimization:
Use data/famous quotes to introduce the topic at the beginning, use "viewpoints + arguments + examples" in the middle paragraphs, and summarize + suggestions at the end.

##### Translation (1 hour per day)
​​
**Goal**: 15% of the translation score must reach **95+**
​​
**Real exam practice**:
1 Chinese-English real exam question per day, focusing on accumulating Chinese culture and history vocabulary (such as "Four Great Inventions" translated into Four Great Inventions).

​​Skill enhancement:
Avoid word-for-word translation, first split the main body of the sentence (subject, predicate, object), and then add modifying elements (such as attributive clauses).
Use conversion structures (such as active to passive) and linking words (such as therefore, in addition) to improve fluency.
