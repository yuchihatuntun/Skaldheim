### Process

#### Step 1: Self-check before checking the answers

##### ​Completeness check​​

Whether key words or sentences (such as cultural terms, numbers, logical conjunctions) are omitted.

##### ​Grammar and spelling check​​

Whether the subject-verb agreement, tense (present tense/perfect tense), singular and plural, and articles (a/an/the) are wrong.

##### ​Logical coherence check​​

Whether the word order is adjusted according to English habits (such as the Chinese "causality" is often placed at the end, but the English needs to be placed at the beginning).

#### Step 2: Compare the reference answers sentence by sentence

##### Compare core vocabulary and expressions

Record <span style="background:rgba(252, 163, 180, 0.55)">more precise terms</span> or collocations in the reference answers.

##### ​Analysis of sentence differences

Observe the splitting method of complex sentences (long Chinese sentence → short English sentence + conjunction).

##### ​​Compare the scoring standards

Correct low-level errors (such as spelling errors, misuse of prepositions) according to the scoring level (13-15 points require "no language errors")

> The successful research for Beidou satelite navigation system has been an essential scientific achievement since the Reveal and Opening up. The researchers worked out a series of technical problems after continus hard work, making the Beidou system support global cover as well as high accuracy which makes China become one of the countries that own the global satelite navigation system uniquely. Beidou system has been widely used in trasportation, disaster saving, weather report, public security and so on. It has been highly praised over the world, and bocome to provide service for more and more countries and regions.

> The successful development of the Beidou satellite navigation system is a major scientific achievement since China's Reform and Opening-up. Through relentless efforts, researchers overcame a series of technical challenges, ultimately enabling the system to achieve global coverage and high-precision positioning. This has made China one of the few countries in the world to independently possess a global satellite navigation system. The Beidou system has been widely applied in transportation, disaster rescue, weather forecasting, public security, and many other fields. It has now gained extensive international recognition and has begun providing high-quality services to an increasing number of countries and regions.
