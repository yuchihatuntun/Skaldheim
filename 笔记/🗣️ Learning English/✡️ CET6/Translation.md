### Process

#### Step 1: Self-check before checking the answers

##### ​Completeness check​​

Whether key words or sentences (such as cultural terms, numbers, logical conjunctions) are omitted.

##### ​Grammar and spelling check​​

Whether the subject-verb agreement, tense (present tense/perfect tense), singular and plural, and articles (a/an/the) are wrong.

##### ​Logical coherence check​​

Whether the word order is adjusted according to English habits (such as the Chinese "causality" is often placed at the end, but the English needs to be placed at the beginning).

#### Step 2: Compare the reference answers sentence by sentence

##### Compare core vocabulary and expressions

Record <span style="background:rgba(252, 163, 180, 0.55)">more precise terms</span> or collocations in the reference answers.

##### ​Analysis of sentence differences

Observe the splitting method of complex sentences (long Chinese sentence → short English sentence + conjunction).

##### ​​Compare the scoring standards

Correct low-level errors (such as spelling errors, misuse of prepositions) according to the scoring level (13-15 points require "no language errors")
