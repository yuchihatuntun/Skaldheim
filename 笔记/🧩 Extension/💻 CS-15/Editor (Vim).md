As programmers, we spend most of our time editing code, so it's worth taking the time to master an editor that works for you. Learning to use a new editor usually involves the following steps:

- **Read a tutorial** (like this one and the resources we provide for you)
- **Stick to it** for all your editing (even if it makes you less productive at first)
- **Check it out**: If it looks like there's a more convenient way to do something, <span style="background:rgba(252, 163, 180, 0.55)">there usually is</span>.

### Which editor should I learn?

Programmers are often very particular about the text editor they use.

What is the most popular editor right now? According to a Stack Overflow survey (which may not be as objective as we think, because Stack Overflow users are not representative of all programmers), <span style="background:rgba(252, 163, 180, 0.55)">Visual Studio Code</span> is the most popular code editor. <span style="background:rgba(252, 163, 180, 0.55)">Vim</span> is the most popular **command-line editor**.

##### Vim

All the instructors in this course use Vim as their editor. Vim has a long history; it started as the Vi editor in 1976 and is still under development. Vim has many clever design ideas, so many other tools support Vim mode (for example, 1.4 million people have installed Vim emulation for VS code). Even if you end up using another editor, Vim is worth learning.

Since it is impossible to teach all of Vim's features in 50 minutes, we will focus on explaining Vim's design philosophy, teaching you the basics, showing some advanced features, and then giving you the resources you need to master the tool.
