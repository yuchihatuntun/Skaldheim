### Purpose

My goal is to lose as much weight as possible from 89 kg to 85 kg, mainly through a combination of dieting and aerobic exercise.

### Planning

#### Aerobic exercise

At home, I mainly rely on exercise bikes for physical exercise, and later (starting around July 28) I also started running.

##### The second week at home
