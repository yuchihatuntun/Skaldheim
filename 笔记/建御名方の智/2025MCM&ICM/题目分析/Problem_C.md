In addition to watching individual events during the latest summer Olympic Games in Paris, 
2024, fans followed the overall “medal table” for each country. The final results (Table 1) 
showed the United States with the most total medals (126), and China and the United States tied  at the top of the standings for the first place Gold medals (40). The host country, France, was 5th in the Gold medal count (16) standings but 4th in terms of total medal count while Great Britain, 7th with 14 Gold medals finished 3rd in total medals. 

在最近的巴黎夏季奥运会期间，除了观看单项比赛外，球迷们还关注各国的总 “奖牌榜”、 "奖牌榜"。最终结果（表 1） 显示美国获得的奖牌总数最多（126 枚），中国和美国并列金牌榜首位（40 枚）。东道主法国在金牌数（16 枚）排行榜上名列第五，但在奖牌总数上名列第四，而英国以 14 枚金牌名列第七，在奖牌总数上名列第三。

The standings at the top of the table are always watched closely, but the medal counts for other countries are often just as valued. For example, Albania (2 medals), Cabo Verde, Dominica, and Saint Lucia (2 medals) won their nations' first Olympic medals at the Paris games. Dominica and Saint Lucia also each earned a Gold medal at these games. More than 60 countries have still yet to win an Olympic medal.
排名靠前的国家总是备受关注，但其他国家的奖牌数往往也同样受到重视。例如，阿尔巴尼亚（2 枚奖牌）、佛得角、多米尼克和圣卢西亚（2 枚奖牌）在巴黎奥运会上赢得了本国的首枚奥运奖牌。多米尼克和圣卢西亚还在这些比赛中各获得一枚金牌。==目前仍有 60 多个国家尚未获得奥运奖牌==。

Predictions of the final medal counts are commonly made, but typically not based on historical medal counts but closer to the start of an upcoming Olympic games when current athletes scheduled to compete are known (for example:
对==最终奖牌数的预测==很常见，但通常不是基于历史奖牌数，而是在临近即将举行的奥运会开幕时，当已知**当前运动员的参赛计划**时（例如：在奥运会开幕前，运动员的奖牌数就会增加）：

Data is provided of medal tables for all summer Olympic games, host countries, as well as the number of Olympic events at each games broken down by sport for all summer Olympic games played. Additionally, data for all individual Olympic competitors with their sport and result (medal type, or no medal) is provided. ==Your models and data analysis must ONLY use the provided data sets.== You may use additional resources to provide background and context or help with interpreting results (be sure to document the sources). Specifically, use the provided data to:
提供的数据包括所有夏季奥运会的奖牌榜、主办国，以及所有夏季奥运会按运动项目分列的每场比赛的奥运项目数量。此外，还提供了所有奥运选手的个人数据，包括他们的运动项目和成绩（奖牌类型或无奖牌）。您的模型和数据分析必须只使用所提供的数据集。您可以使用其他资源来提供背景情况或帮助解释结果。

- Develop a model for medal counts for each country (for Gold and total medals at a minimum). Include estimates of the uncertainty/precision of your model predictions and measures of how well model performs.(为每个国家的奖牌数建立一个模型（至少包括金牌数和奖牌总数）。包括对模型预测的不确定性/精确度的估计，以及对模型性能的衡量。)
	- Based on your model, what are your projections for the medal table in the Los Angeles, USA summer Olympics in 2028? Include prediction intervals for all results. Which countries do you believe are most likely to improve? Which will do worse than in 2024?（根据您的模型，您对 2028 年美国洛杉矶夏季奥运会的==奖牌榜==有何预测？包括所有结果的预测区间。您认为哪些国家的成绩最有可能提高？哪些国家的成绩会比 2024 年差？）
	- Your model should include countries that have yet to earn medals; what is your projection for how many will earn their first medal in the next Olympics? What sort of odds do you give to this estimate?（您的模型应包括尚未获得奖牌的国家；您预计有多少国家将在下届奥运会上获得==第一枚奖牌==？您对这一估计给出的==概率==是多少？）
	- Your model should also consider the events (number and types) at a given Olympics. Explore the relationship between the events and how many medals countries earn. What sports are most important for various countries? Why? How do the events chosen by the home country impact results?（您的模型还应考虑特定奥运会的项目（数量和类型）。探索==项目与国家获得奖牌数量之间的关系==。哪些项目对不同国家最重要？本国选择的项目对结果有何影响？）
- Athletes may compete for different countries, but it is not a simple matter for them to change due to citizenship requirements. Coaches, however, can easily move from one country to another as they do not need to be citizens to coach. There is, therefore, the possibility of a “great coach” effect. Two possible examples of this include Lang Ping[2], who coached volleyball teams from both the U.S. and China to championships, and the sometimes-controversial gymnastics coach, Béla Károlyi[3], who coached Romania and then the U.S. women’s teams with great success. Examine the data for evidence of changes that might be due to a “great coach” effect. How much do you estimate such an effect contributes to medal counts? Choose three countries and identify sports where they should consider investing in a “great” coach and estimate that impact.
	运动员可以代表不同的国家参加比赛，但由于公民身份的要求，他们并不容易改变。然而，教练员却可以很容易地从一个国家转到另一个国家，因为他们不需要公民身份就可以执教。因此，有可能产生 “伟大教练 ”效应。郎平[2] 和贝拉-卡洛里[3] 就是两个可能的例子，前者曾执教中美两国的排球队并获得冠军，后者曾执教罗马尼亚和美国女子体操队并取得巨大成功。研究数据，寻找可能由 “伟大教练 ”效应引起的变化的证据。您估计这种效应对奖牌数的影响有多大？选择三个国家，确定它们应考虑投资 “优秀 ”教练的体育项目，并估计其影响。
