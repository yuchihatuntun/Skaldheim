- Athletes may compete for different countries, but it is not a simple matter for them to change due to citizenship requirements. Coaches, however, can easily move from one country to another as they do not need to be citizens to coach. There is, therefore, the possibility of a “great coach” effect. Two possible examples of this include Lang Ping[2], who coached volleyball teams from both the U.S. and China to championships, and the sometimes-controversial gymnastics coach, Béla Károlyi[3], who coached Romania and then the U.S. women’s teams with great success. Examine the data for evidence of changes that might be due to a “great coach” effect. How much do you estimate such an effect contributes to medal counts? Choose three countries and identify sports where they should consider investing in a “great” coach and estimate that impact.
	运动员可以代表不同的国家参加比赛，但由于公民身份的要求，他们并不容易改变。然而，教练员却可以很容易地从一个国家转到另一个国家，因为他们不需要公民身份就可以执教。因此，有可能产生 “伟大教练 ”效应。郎平[2] 和贝拉-卡洛里[3] 就是两个可能的例子，前者曾执教中美两国的排球队并获得冠军，后者曾执教罗马尼亚和美国女子体操队并取得巨大成功。研究数据，寻找可能由 “伟大教练 ”效应引起的变化的证据。您估计==这种效应对奖牌数的影响有多大==？**选择三个国家，确定它们应考虑投资 “优秀 ”教练的体育项目，并估计其影响**。
