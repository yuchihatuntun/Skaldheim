The carbon cycle describes the process of the exchange of carbon throughout the geochemical cycle of the Earth, and is a vital component for life on the planet. Part of the carbon cycle includes the decomposition of compounds, allowing carbon to be renewed and used in other forms. One key component of this part of the process is the decomposition of plant material and woody fibers.
碳循环描述了整个地球地球化学循环中的碳交换过程，是地球上生命的重要组成部分。碳循环的一部分包括化合物的分解，使碳得以更新并以其他形式使用。这部分过程的一个关键组成部分是植物材料和木质纤维的分解。

Some of the key agents in decomposing woody fibers are fungi. The authors of a recent research article on wood decomposition by fungi identified fungi traits that determine decomposition rates and also noted links between certain traits[1]. In particular, the slow growing strains of fungi tend to be better able to survive and grow in the presence of environmental changes with respect to moisture and temperature, while the faster growing strains tend to be less robust to the same changes. A synopsis of this article can be found below on page 3.
分解木质纤维的一些关键媒介是真菌。最近一篇关于真菌分解木材的研究文章的作者确定了==决定分解速度的真菌性状，并指出了某些性状之间的联系==[1]。特别是，生长缓慢的真菌菌株往往能在湿度和温度发生变化的环境中更好地生存和生长，而生长较快的菌株往往对同样的变化不太适应。

These researchers examined a large number of traits associated with different fungi and their role in the decomposition of ground litter (dead plant material) and woody fibers. For this MCM Problem you should focus on just two traits of a fungus: the growth rate of the fungus and the fungus’ tolerance to moisture. Your primary goal is to model the decomposition of woody fibers in a given patch of land, and do so in the presence of multiple types of fungi breaking down woody fibers in the same area.
这些研究人员研究了与不同真菌相关的大量特征，以及它们在分解地面垃圾（死亡植物材料）和木质纤维中的作用。在本模块问题中，您只需关注真菌的两个特征：真菌的==生长速度==和真菌对==水分的耐受性==。您的主要目标是模拟特定土地上木质纤维的分解过程，并在同一区域有多种类型的真菌分解木质纤维的情况下进行。

As you explore the relationship of the two traits of interest, growth rate and moisture tolerance, with the rate of decomposition, several questions may arise to include: Using these two traits, how do the different fungi interact and decompose ground litter in a fixed patch of land in different environments? Within these different environments, how will the decomposition be impacted over time as conditions vary? How do environmental changes and the variation in environmental change impact the long-term dynamics with respect to decomposition, as well as competition between fungi in a given environment? The estimation for the decomposition rates, given the growth rate, is shown in Figure 1. The estimation of the decomposition rates, given the relative moisture tolerance, is shown in Figure 2.
在探索生长速度和耐湿性这两个相关性状与分解速度的关系时，可能会出现以下几个问题： 
- 利用这两个性状，不同真菌在不同环境中==如何相互作用并分解固定土地上的地面垃圾==？
- 在这些不同的环境中，随着时间的推移，条件的变化会对分解产生怎样的影响？
- 环境变化和环境变化的差异如何影响分解的长期动态以及特定环境中==真菌之间的竞争==？

Requirement: Your paper should explore and address the following aspects.
- Build a mathematical model that describes the breakdown of ground litter and woody fibers through fungal activity in the presence of multiple species of fungi.
	建立一个数学模型，**描述在多种真菌存在的情况下，通过真菌活动分解地面垃圾和木质纤维的过程**。
- In your model, incorporate the interactions between different species of fungi, which have different growth rates and different moisture tolerances as shown in Figures 1 and 2.
	如图 1 和图 2 所示，不同种类的真菌具有不同的生长速度和对湿度的耐受性，在您的模型中要考虑到不同种类真菌之间的相互作用。
- Provide an analysis of the model and describe the interactions between the different types of fungi. The dynamics of the interactions should be characterized and described including both short- and long-term trends. Your analysis should examine the sensitivity to rapid fluctuations in the environment, and you should determine the overall impact of changing atmospheric trends to assess the impact of variation of local weather patterns.
	对模型进行分析，描述不同类型真菌之间的相互作用。应描述相互作用的动态特征，包括短期和长期趋势。您的分析应研究对环境快速波动的敏感性，并应确定大气趋势变化的总体影响，以评估当地天气模式变化的影响。
- Include predictions about the relative advantages and disadvantages for each species and combinations of species likely to persist, and do so for different environments including arid, semi-arid, temperate, arboreal, and tropical rain forests.
	包括预测每个物种和可能持续存在的物种组合的相对优势和劣势，并针对不同环境进行预测，包括干旱、半干旱、温带、乔木林和热带雨林。
- Describe how the diversity of fungal communities of a system impacts the overall efficiency of a system with respect to the breakdown of ground litter. Predict the importance and role of biodiversity in the presence of different degrees of variability in the local environment.
	描述系统中真菌群落的多样性如何影响系统分解地面垃圾的整体效率。预测生物多样性在当地环境存在不同程度变异的情况下的重要性和作用。

Include a two-page article of your results. Your article should be appropriate for inclusion in an introductory college level biology textbook to discuss recent developments in our understanding of the roles fungi play in ecological systems.
