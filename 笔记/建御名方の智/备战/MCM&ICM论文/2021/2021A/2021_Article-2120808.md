Fungi decompose organics into inorganics through their respiration, playing a crucial role in the ecosystem. In this paper, in order to discuss their decomposition ability, multiple species interaction, and significance of biodiversity, we establish three models: Fungal Decomposition Model, Fungai Propagation Model and Fungal Population Competition Model.
真菌通过呼吸作用将有机物分解为无机物，在生态系统中发挥着至关重要的作用。本文针对真菌的分解能力、多物种相互作用以及生物多样性的意义，建立了三个模型： ==真菌分解模型、真菌传播模型和真菌种群竞争模型==。

To begin with, we collect the original experimental data in literature. After cleaning off redundant values, we finally obtain 34 fungal samples. Then we examine their credibility through conclusions of reference paper offered in requirement. Further, we sort these 34 samples into 3 categories through hierarchical clustering method in light of their moisture tolerance and hyphal extension rate. It covers Sprinter, Middle-distance runner, and Long-distance runner. Moreover, we put forward 4 potential models for fungal decomposition. Then, applying multiple linear regression analysis, we obtain Fungal Decomposition Model for multi species after comparison.
首先，我们收集文献中的原始实验数据。在清除冗余值后，我们最终获得了 34 个真菌样本。然后，我们通过要求提供的参考文献的结论来检验它们的可信度。然后，我们根据这 34 个样本的耐湿性和菌丝伸展率，通过分层聚类法将其分为 3 类。其中包括短跑运动员、中长跑运动员和长跑运动员。此外，我们还提出了 4 种潜在的真菌分解模型。然后，运用多元线性回归分析，经过比较得出多物种的真菌分解模型。

Then, we establish population growth model for single species based on the differential equation. Further, we obtain the Fungal Propagation Model by introducing a relative environmental impact factor. Besides, we build Fungal Population Competition model. Likewise, we quantify the interaction between fungi and environment by the introduction of relative environmental impact factor. Based on these models, we conduct simulations and find that multiple species community’s population scale is 1.5 times that of single species and its decomposition rate will be 1.45 times on the condition of optimal environment and same initial proportions.
然后基于微分方程建立单物种种群增长模型，进一步引入相对环境影响因子得到真菌繁殖模型，并建立真菌种群竞争模型，同样通过引入相对环境影响因子量化真菌与环境的相互作用。基于这些模型进行模拟发现，在最优环境条件下，相同初始比例下，多物种群落的种群规模是单物种群落的1.5倍，其分解速率将是单物种群落的1.45倍。

Next, we clarified the concrete form of environmental fluctuations. We assume that moisture in environment and temperature change periodically like trigonometric functions. Further, combining the models we established before, we analyze the sensitivity of fungal population scale and decomposition rate to rapid fluctuations in the environment both in short-term and long-term. We find that fungi, especially multiple species community, are susceptible to environmental fluctuations in the short term but stay stable in the long term. Likewise, we conduct simulations and find that multiple species community’s population scale will be 1.18 times that of single species and decomposition rate will be 0.93 times under environmental fluctuations.
接下来明确了环境波动的具体形式，假设环境中的水分和温度像三角函数一样呈周期性变化，并结合之前建立的模型，分别分析了真菌种群规模和分解速率对短期和长期环境快速波动的敏感性。我们发现，真菌，尤其是多物种群落，短期内易受环境波动的影响，但长期内保持稳定。同样，我们进行模拟发现，在环境波动下，多物种群落的种群规模将是单一物种的1.18倍，分解速率将是单一物种的0.93倍。

Besides, we predict the performance of 4 combination of multiple species in different environment respectively, which includes arid, semi-arid, temperate, arboreal, and tropical rain forests. Moreover, we propose the best combination, the relative advantages and disadvantages of each species in these environments. We also find that fungi community which contains more species tend to survive more easily. Further, we compare the composition rate of single species and multiple species under optimal environmental conditions and fluctuations to illustrate the role and significance of biodiversity. We conclude that fungi system with rich biodiversity are more stable and propagate better under environmental fluctuations.

Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the models and offer scientific-based and introductory article for college students
