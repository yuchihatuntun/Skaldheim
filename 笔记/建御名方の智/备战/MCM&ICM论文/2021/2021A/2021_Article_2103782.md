# Abstract
Fungi, as almost the only lignin-decomposing species on Earth, play an important role in the global carbon cycle. In this paper, a mathematical model is established to analyze various factors affecting the decomposition rate of woody fibers by fungi, so as to deepen the understanding of the relationship between fungal communities and ecosystem functions.
真菌作为地球上几乎唯一的木质素分解菌种，在全球碳循环中发挥着重要作用。本文通过建立数学模型，分析影响真菌分解木质纤维速率的各种因素，以深化对真菌群落与生态系统功能之间关系的认识。

Firstly， we establish a Logistic Growth Model based on the interactions between different species of fungi. Considering the growth model and the moisture tolerance of the fungus, the decomposition rate model of fungi on woody fibers is constructed. Then, we use the collected fungal dataset and obtain the unknown parameters of the model. Next, we choose a combination of fungi to test the model. The relative error between the calculated decomposition rate and the actual value is as low as 5.5%. Meanwhile, the interactions between different species of fungi in a fixed patch of land are analyzed.
首先，建立基于真菌种间相互作用的==Logistic生长模型==，综合考虑真菌的生长模式和耐湿性，构建真菌对木质纤维的分解速率模型。然后，利用采集的真菌数据集，得到模型的未知参数。接下来，选取一种真菌组合对模型进行检验，计算出的分解速率与实际值的相对误差低至5.5%。同时，分析了固定地块内不同种类真菌之间的相互作用。

Secondly, considering the rapid environmental fluctuations, we analyze the effect of humidity on fungal activity in detail. We select a typical climate to study the short-term and long-term trends of fungal growth and decomposition rate, as well as the interaction between fungi. We find that the increase of environmental humidity can promote the growth of fungi with different promotion degree. Meanwhile, the relative competitive advantages of various fungi are different when atmospheric trends change. This will lead to the succession of fungal communities in different directions. Moreover, we also find that fungi with stronger moisture tolerance are more likely to occupy a dominant position in the arid environment.
其次，考虑到环境的快速波动，详细分析了湿度对真菌活动的影响。选取典型气候，研究真菌生长和分解速率的短期和长期趋势，以及真菌之间的相互作用。研究发现，环境湿度的增加可以促进真菌的生长，但促进程度不同。同时，当大气趋势发生变化时，各类真菌的相对竞争优势不同。这将导致真菌群落向不同的方向演替。此外，我们还发现，耐湿性较强的真菌更容易在干旱环境中占据优势地位。

Thirdly, we employ K-means algorithm to cluster the collected dataset of fungi and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of fungal species and combinations of species in different environments. In terms of the difference of environmental humidity, we find that fungal communities with stable characteristics are more dominant in low humidity environments. When the changing rate of environmental humidity is different, fungi with slower hyphal extension rate and stronger moisture tolerance are more robust to the environmental changes. For the environment with little climate change, such as tropical rain forest, fungi with faster growth rate and weaker moisture tolerance are more dominant. What’s more, fungi with similar characteristics are more likely to coexist.

Fourthly, the result of negative impact of environmental changes on a relatively single fungal community indicates that the more abundant species diversity, the more capable of adapting to the environmental changes. Thus, the decomposition rate can be maintained at a high level, which is conducive to the carbon cycle.

Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of the unknown parameters, and it shows that the model has strong adaptability and is easier to popularize. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of the model are also analyzed
