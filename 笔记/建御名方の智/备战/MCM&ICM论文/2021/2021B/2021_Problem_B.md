# Background
The 2019-2020 fire season in Australia saw devastating wildfires in every state, with the worst impact in New South Wales and eastern Victoria. The wildfires occurred during a severe drought and persistent heat wave exacerbated by climate-change. Figure 1 shows the wildfire hot spots in this area from October 1, 2019 to January 7, 2020, with yellow showing fires from October 1st to January 6th, and red showing active fires on January 7, 2020.
2019-2020 年澳大利亚火灾季，每个州都发生了毁灭性的山火，新南威尔士州和维多利亚州东部受灾最为严重。山火发生在严重干旱和持续热浪期间，气候变化加剧了这种情况。图 1 显示了该地区 2019 年 10 月 1 日至 2020 年 1 月 7 日的山火热点，黄色表示 10 月 1 日至 1 月 6 日的火灾，红色表示 2020 年 1 月 7 日的活跃火灾。

Firefighters have used drones for surveillance and situational awareness (SSA) for several years; SSA drones carry high definition & thermal imaging cameras and telemetry sensors that monitor and report data from wearable devices on front-line personnel. Wearable devices can be used as Personal Locator Beacons or more complex environmental monitors. SSA drones help monitor the evolving situation, letting the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) best direct active crews for optimal effect and maximal safety.
消防员多年来一直使用无人机进行监视和态势感知 (SSA)；SSA 无人机携带高清和热成像摄像机以及遥测传感器，可监控和报告一线人员可穿戴设备的数据。可穿戴设备可用作个人定位信标或更复杂的环境监测器。SSA 无人机有助于监测不断变化的情况，让紧急行动中心 (EOC) 能够最好地指挥活跃的工作人员，以实现最佳效果和最大安全性。

Two-way radio communication allows “boots-on-the-ground” forward teams to give status reports to the EOC and allows the EOC to give orders directly to forward teams. Deployed personnel carry handheld two-way radios operating in the VHF/UHF bands. The range of handheld radios is limited by their low transmitting power, typically a maximum of 5 watts, and is determined mainly by distance and physical topography in rural areas or “building topography” in urban areas; weather has little effect on VHF/UHF signals. A 5-watt radio has a nominal range of 5 km over flat, unobstructed ground, but drops to 2 km in an urban area. Repeaters, transceivers that automatically rebroadcast signals at higher powers, can extend radio range. A repeater located between the front lines and the EOC can relay radio signals both from the front lines to the EOC and from the EOC to the front lines. The range of a repeater is also determined by distance and topography, but is significantly greater than lower power handheld radios.
双向无线电通信使“地面部队”前线小队能够向 EOC 报告状态，并允许 EOC 直接向前线小队下达命令。部署人员携带在 VHF/UHF 频段工作的手持双向无线电。手持无线电的范围受限于其低发射功率，通常最大为 5 瓦，并且主要由农村地区的距离和地形或城市地区的“建筑物地形”决定；天气对 VHF/UHF 信号影响不大。5 瓦无线电在平坦、无障碍地面上的标称范围为 5 公里，但在城市地区降至 2 公里。中继器（自动以更高功率重新广播信号的收发器）可以扩大无线电范围。位于前线和 EOC 之间的中继器可以将无线电信号从前线中继到 EOC，也可以从 EOC 中继到前线。中继器的范围也由距离和地形决定，但比低功率手持无线电大得多。

Recently, hovering drones carrying repeaters have been used to dramatically extend the range of low power radios on the front lines. A 10-watt repeater, weighing 1.3 kg carried by a drone hovering well above ground level, can achieve a range of 20 km. Akme Corporation's prototype WileE–15.2X hybrid drone is projected to cost approximately $10,000 (AUD) when equipped with either a radio repeater or video & telemetry capability. Tests have shown this drone has the capabilities listed in Table 1
最近，携带中继器的悬停无人机已被用来大幅扩大前线低功率无线电的覆盖范围。一台重 1.3 公斤、由悬停在地面上方的无人机携带的 10 瓦中继器可以达到 20 公里的覆盖范围。Akme Corporation 的原型 WileE-15.2X 混合无人机在配备无线电中继器或视频和遥测功能时预计成本约为 10,000 澳元。测试表明，这种无人机具有表 1 中列出的功能
# Requirements
1. Create a model to determine the optimal numbers and mix of SSA drones and Radio Repeater drones to purchase for a proposed new division, “Rapid Bushfire Response”, of Victoria’s Country Fire Authority (CFA). Your model should balance capability and safety with economics, as well as consider observational and communications mission needs and topography. Your model should also incorporate fire event size and frequency as parameters.
