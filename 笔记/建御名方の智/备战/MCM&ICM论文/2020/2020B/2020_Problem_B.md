Wherever there are recreational sandy ocean beaches in the world, there seem to be children (and adults) creating sandcastles on the seashore. Using tools, toys, and imagination, beach goers create sandcastles that range from simple mounds of sand to complicated replicas of actual castles with walls, towers, moats, and other features that mimic real castles. In all these, one typically forms an initial foundation consisting of a single, nondescript mound of wetted sand, and then proceeds to cut and shape this base into a recognizable 3-dimensional geometric shape upon which to build the more castle-defining features.
世界上任何有休闲沙滩的地方，似乎都有孩子（和成人）在海边堆沙堡。沙滩游客利用工具、玩具和想象力，堆起的沙堡从简单的沙堆到复杂的真实城堡复制品，带有墙壁、塔楼、护城河和其他模仿真实城堡的特征。在所有这些沙堡中，人们通常先形成一个由单一、不起眼的湿沙堆组成的初始地基，然后继续==切割和塑造这个底座，使其成为可识别的三维几何形状==，在此基础上建造更具城堡特色的特征。

Inevitably, the inflow of ocean waves coupled with rising tides erodes sandcastles. It appears, however, that not all sandcastles react the same way to waves and tides, even if built roughly the same size and at roughly the same distance from the water on the same beach. Consequently, one wonders if there exists a best 3-dimensional geometric shape to use for a sandcastle foundation.

Requirements

1. Construct a mathematical model to identify the best 3-dimensional geometric shape to use as a sandcastle foundation that will last the longest period of time on a seashore that experiences waves and tides under the following conditions:
	建立一个数学模型，以确定==最适合用作沙堡地基的三维几何形状==，该形状将在以下条件下经历海浪和潮汐的海岸上持续最长时间
	- built at roughly the same distance from the water on the same beach, and built using the same type of sand, roughly the same amount of sand, and the same waterto-sand proportion.
		建造地点位于同一片海滩，距离水域的距离大致相同，并且使用相同类型的沙子、大致相同数量的沙子以及相同的水沙比例建造。
2. Using your model, determine an optimal sand-to-water mixture proportion for the castle foundation, assuming you use no other additives or materials (e.g. plastic or wooden supports, stones, etc.)
	使用您的模型，确定城堡地基的==最佳沙水混合比例==，假设您不使用其他添加剂或材料（例如塑料或木质支架、石头等）
3. Adjust your model as needed to determine how the best 3-dimensional sandcastle foundation you identified in requirement 1 is affected by rain, and whether it remains the best 3-dimensional geometric shape to be used as a castle foundation when it is raining.
	根据需要调整模型，以确定您在要求 1 中确定的最佳 3 维沙堡地基如何受到雨水的影响，以及它在下雨时是否仍然是用作城堡地基的最佳 3 维几何形状。
4. What other strategies, if any, might you use to make your sandcastle last longer?
	如果有的话，您还可以使用哪些其他策略来==让您的沙堡持续更长时间==？
5. Finally, write an informative, one- to two-page article describing your model and its results for publication in the vacation magazine: Fun in the Sun, whose readers are mainly non-technical.
	最后，撰写一篇一到两页的内容丰富的文章，描述您的模型及其结果，并在度假杂志《阳光下的乐趣》上发表，该杂志的读者主要是非技术人员。
