# Abstract
Sandcastle building is a common way to recreating for beach goers. Sand lovers always rack their brains to build a stronger castle and take pride in it. Still, sandcastle is inevitably eroded by the waves and tides. Therefore, how to establish a stable foundation is of great significance to the duration of sand castles.
堆沙堡是沙滩爱好者的常见娱乐方式，沙堡爱好者总是绞尽脑汁建造一座更坚固的城堡并以此为荣。然而，沙堡不可避免地会被海浪和潮汐侵蚀，因此如何建立稳定的地基对沙堡的寿命至关重要。

In order to explore the most stable three-dimensional geometric shape, we establish a periodic sand-water cell automaton model to experiment with the most likely multiple geometric shapes. We discretize the sand base into a three-dimensional geometry consisting of a stack of rigid sand cells and water cells. Based on the knowledge of engineering mechanics and the feasibility in practice, we select five types of inertial frustum which has significant characteristics: triangular frustum, square frustum, sixarris frustum, conical frustum, ellipse frustum and so on for simulation experiments. The optimum geometric shape we obtain is triangle frustum.
为了探索最稳定的三维几何形状，我们建立了一个==周期性的沙-水细胞自动机模型==，对最有可能的多种几何形状进行实验。我们将沙基离散化为由刚性沙细胞和水细胞堆叠组成的三维几何体。基于工程力学知识和实践可行性，我们选择了具有显著特性的五种类型的惯性截头体：三棱截头体、方截头体、六棱截头体、圆锥截头体、椭圆截头体等进行模拟实验。我们得到的最优几何形状是三棱截头体。

In the model, we formulate the state transition rules through multivariate analysis based on multi-criteria judgments, and carry out quantitative calculations on the waves’ sediment carrying and capillary phenomena between sand and water. We employ complex trigonometric functions to simulate and reproduce the tidal waves in three dimensions. Therefore, through regression analysis of the data obtained from multiple experiments on each frustum, we have obtained a reliable and optimal geometric shape result. Besides, it can be quantified and visualized.
在模型中，我们通过基于多准则判断的多元分析来制定状态转换规则，并对波浪的携沙作用和沙子与水之间的毛细现象进行定量计算。我们利用复杂的三角函数来模拟和再现三维空间中的潮汐波浪。因此，通过对每个截头体进行多次实验所获得的数据进行回归分析，我们得到了可靠且最优的几何形状结果。此外，它可以量化和可视化。

In the practice of building sand castles, it was found that different sand-to-water mixture ratios also played a crucial role in the sand foundations’ stability. By using the sand-water cell automaton model of problem 1, we use the concentration gradient method to adjust the water-sand ratio and obtain a series of data points on the sand-to-water proportion and the sand-based stability. Then we use the least squares polynomial function approximation to fit the curve of these data. Therefore, we obtain an estimated function of sand-to-water ratio and sand-base stability. Then we can find that the optimal sand-to-water mixture proportion is 0.55.
在沙堡建造实践中发现，不同的砂水混合比对沙基稳定性也起到至关重要的作用。利用问题1的砂水元胞自动机模型，利用浓度梯度法调整水砂比，得到一系列关于砂水比和沙基稳定性的数据点，再利用==最小二乘多项式函数逼近拟合这些数据的曲线==，从而得到砂水比与沙基稳定性的估计函数，得出最佳砂水混合比为0.55。

In order to study rain’s effect on the result, we introduce a rainfall module based on the original model. It will work on the sandy base with the wave tide module. Similarly, we get a series of data for regression analysis. We find that the original best geometry does not the only one which perform well under rainfall conditions, and ellipse frustum is the another better geometry when it is rainy.
为了研究降雨对结果的影响，我们在原模型的基础上引入了降雨模块，与波浪潮汐模块一起作用于沙基，同样得到一系列数据进行回归分析，发现原有的最佳几何形状并不是唯一在降雨条件下表现良好的形状，椭圆截头体是另一种在降雨条件下表现更好的几何形状。

Sensitivity analysis shows the strong robustness of our model. Meanwhile, we also propose some other strategies for increasing the stability of the sandy base. Subsequently, we summarize the experimental models and conclusions into plain language for publication on Fun in the Sun.
敏感性分析表明我们的模型具有很强的稳健性。同时，我们还提出了一些其他提高沙基稳定性的策略。随后，我们将实验模型和结论总结成通俗易懂的语言，发表在《阳光下的乐趣》上。

In addition, our model is easy to implement and extend. By changing few parameters in our code, we can stimulate more complex conditions on the beach.
此外，我们的模型易于实现和扩展。只需更改代码中的几个参数，我们就可以模拟海滩上更复杂的情况。
