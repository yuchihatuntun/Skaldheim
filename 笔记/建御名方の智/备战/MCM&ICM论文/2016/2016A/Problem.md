A person fills a bathtub with hot water from a single faucet and settles into the bathtub to cleanse and relax. Unfortunately, the bathtub is not a spa-style tub with a secondary heating system and circulating jets, but rather a simple water containment vessel. After a while, the bath gets noticeably cooler, so the person adds a constant trickle of hot water from the faucet to reheat the bathing water. The bathtub is designed in such a way that when the tub reaches its capacity, excess water escapes through an overflow drain.
一个人从一个水龙头向浴缸中注入热水，然后躺在浴缸中清洗和放松。不幸的是，浴缸并不是带有二次加热系统和循环喷头的水疗浴缸，而是一个简单的盛水容器。一段时间后，浴缸里的水会明显变凉，因此人们会不断地从水龙头中注入热水，重新加热浴缸里的水。浴缸的设计方式是，当浴缸达到其容量时，多余的水会通过溢流排水口排出。

Develop a model of the temperature of the bathtub water in space and time to determine the best strategy the person in the bathtub can adopt to keep the temperature even throughout the bathtub and as close as possible to the initial temperature without wasting too much water.
建立浴缸水温在空间和时间上的模型，以确定浴缸中的人可以采取的最佳策略，从而在不浪费太多水的情况下保持整个浴缸温度均匀，并尽可能接近初始温度。

Use your model to determine the extent to which your strategy depends upon the shape and volume of the tub, the shape/volume/temperature of the person in the bathtub, and the motions made by the person in the bathtub. If the person used a bubble bath additive while initially filling the bathtub to assist in cleansing, how would this affect your model’s results?
使用您的模型确定您的策略在多大程度上取决于浴缸的形状和容积、浴缸中人的形状/容积/温度以及浴缸中人的动作。如果人在最初注入浴缸时使用了泡泡浴添加剂来帮助清洁，这会对您的模型结果产生什么影响？

In addition to the required one-page summary for your MCM submission, your report must include a one-page non-technical explanation for users of the bathtub that describes your strategy while explaining why it is so difficult to get an evenly maintained temperature throughout the bath water.
除了要求提交的一页纸摘要外，您的报告还必须包括一页纸的非技术性说明，向浴缸使用者介绍您的策略，同时解释为什么很难使整个浴缸的水温保持均匀。
