# Background
Light pollution is used to describe any excessive or poor use of artificial light. Some of the phenomena that we refer to as light pollution include light trespass, over-illumination, and light clutter. These phenomena are most easily observed as a glow in the sky after the sun has set in large cities; however, they may also occur in more remote regions.
光污染用于描述任何过度或不当使用人造光的情况。我们称之为光污染的一些现象包括光侵入、过度照明和光杂乱。这些现象最容易在大城市中观察到，即日落后天空中的光芒；然而，它们也可能发生在更偏远的地区。

Light pollution alters our view of the night sky, has environmental impacts and affects our health and safety. For example, plant maturation may be delayed or accelerated, and migration patterns of wildlife affected. Excessive artificial light may confuse our circadian rhythms, leading to poor sleep quality and perhaps physical and mental health issues. Glare caused by artificial lights may contribute to some motor vehicle accidents.
光污染改变了我们对夜空的看法，对环境产生影响，并影响我们的健康和安全。例如，植物的成熟可能会延迟或加速，野生动物的迁徙模式也会受到影响。过多的人造光可能会扰乱我们的昼夜节律，导致睡眠质量差，甚至可能导致身心健康问题。人造光造成的眩光可能会导致一些机动车事故。

Community officials or local groups may implement intervention strategies to mitigate the negative effects of light pollution. Artificial light, however, has both positive and negative effects that impact different locations in different ways. For example, to avoid the negative impacts of light pollution listed above, some communities opt for low-light neighborhoods which in turn might lead to increased crime. The impacts of light pollution may depend on factors such as the location’s level of development, population, biodiversity, geography, and climate. Therefore, assessing the extent of the effects and the potential impacts of any intervention strategies must be tailored to a specific location
社区官员或当地团体可能会实施干预策略来减轻光污染的负面影响。然而，人造光既有积极的影响，也有消极的影响，对不同的地方有不同的影响。例如，为了避免上述光污染的负面影响，一些社区选择低光照社区，而这反过来可能会导致犯罪率上升。光污染的影响可能取决于地点的发展水平、人口、生物多样性、地理和气候等因素。因此，评估任何干预策略的影响程度和潜在影响必须针对特定地点量身定制。
# Requirements
COMAP’s Illumination Control Mission (ICM) is working to promote awareness of the impacts of light pollution and develop intervention strategies to mitigate those impacts. In support of this ICM work, your task is to address measuring and mitigating the effects of light pollution in various locations, incorporating both human and non-human concerns. Specifically, you should:

- Develop a broadly applicable metric to identify the light pollution risk level of a location.
	制定一个广泛适用的==指标==来**识别某个地点的光污染风险水平**。
- Apply your metric and interpret its results on the following four diverse types of locations(应用您的度量标准并在以下四种不同类型的位置解释其结果):
	- a protected land location,
	- a rural community,
	- a suburban community, 
	- an urban community
- Describe three possible intervention strategies to address light pollution. Discuss specific actions to implement each strategy and the potential impacts of these actions on the effects of light pollution in general.
	描述三种解决光污染的可能==干预策略==。讨论实施每种策略的具体行动以及这些行动对光污染总体影响的潜在影响。
- Choose two of your locations and use your metric to determine which of your intervention strategies is most effective for each of them. Discuss how the chosen intervention strategy impacts the risk level for the location.
	选择两个地点，并使用指标确定哪种干预策略对每个地点最有效。讨论所选干预策略如何影响该地点的风险水平。
- Finally, for one of your identified locations and its most-effective intervention strategy, produce a 1-page flyer to promote the strategy for that location.
	最后，针对您确定的其中一个地点及其最有效的干预策略，制作一份 1 页的传单来宣传该地点的策略
