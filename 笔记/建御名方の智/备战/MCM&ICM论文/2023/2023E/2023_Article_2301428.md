# Abstract
Bright windows, blazing streetlights, pulsating neon...human beings are slowly being deprived of the dark night. Since the invention of artificial light, this artificial light has gradually started to affect animals, plants and human health. It is sad that the technological light that should bring convenience has brought harm. To better measure and intervene in the effects of light pollution, we study light pollution to better enjoy this light.
明亮的窗户、耀眼的路灯、闪烁的霓虹灯……人类正慢慢被剥夺黑夜。自从人造光发明以来，这种人造光逐渐开始影响动物、植物和人类的健康。令人悲哀的是，本应带来便利的科技光却带来了危害。为了更好地衡量和干预光污染的影响，我们研究光污染，以便更好地享受这种光。

Several models are established: Model I: Pollution Quantification Model; Model II: Risk Assessment Model; Model III: Intervention Strategy Model.
建立几个模型：模型一：==污染量化模型==；模型二：==风险评估模型==；模型三：==干预策略模型==。

Prepare for establishing models, we analyzed the composition and main impact aspects of light pollution. By visualizing the results of a large number of data collected from official databases, we initially focused on areas worth studying.
在建立模型之前，我们分析了光污染的构成和主要影响方面。通过从官方数据库收集的大量数据的结果可视化，我们初步关注了值得研究的领域。

For Model I: According to some literature and the results of similar natural system studies, we propose to use human factors, social factors and ecological factors, a total of 13 indicators, combined with EWM-AHP algorithm to obtain objective light pollution quantification results 𝑄𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒, 𝑄𝑛𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒. Then we randomly selected ten areas of light intensity and our model calculation for comparison, the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.8002, which verifies the validity of our model.
对于模型一：根据一些文献和类似自然系统研究的结果，我们提出使用人文因素、社会因素和生态因素共13个指标，结合==EWM-AHP算法==来获得客观的光污染量化结果。然后随机选取了十个区域的光照强度与我们的模型计算结果进行对比，皮尔逊相关系数为0.8002，验证了我们的模型的有效性。

For Model II: We defined a light pollution risk indicator Ω based on the ALARP criterion and "Cost-Risk" analysis, where the negative impact growth rate is assumed to be normally distributed. Based on the literature, we calculate the expectation of 6% and apply Ω to the four regions we selected to evaluate the risk of light pollution after one year and analyze it to propose countermeasures. Theoretically, the model allows for mediumand long-term prediction of light pollution risk.
模型二：我们根据==ALARP标准==和“成本-风险”分析，定义光污染风险指标Ω，其中负面影响增长率假设为正态分布。根据文献，我们计算出6%的期望值，并将Ω应用于我们选择的四个区域，以评估一年后的光污染风险并进行分析，提出应对措施。从理论上讲，该模型可以对光污染风险进行中长期预测。

For Model III: We modeled three different strategies - "energy", "environment", "human security" and related factors respectively, and finally obtained the feasibility of intervention scenarios through coupling coordination analysis, And the final evaluation value of the three aspects is calculated through the secondary indicators after the intervention. We selected two sites, Rutland and Westminster with a coordination index of 5 and 3, to study the impact of the three intervention strategies based on a coupled coordination analysis. The results showed that the best intervention strategy in rural Rutland was the "Human Friendly Strategy", which improved the Human Health Index score by 10%. The best intervention strategy for Westminster was the Resource Friendly Strategy, which improved the overall score from 50.0080 to 59.6481.
对于模型三：我们分别对“能源”、“环境”、“人类安全”三个不同策略及其相关因素进行建模，最终通过耦合协调分析得出干预方案的可行性，并通过干预后的二级指标计算出三方面的最终评价值。我们选取了协调指数分别为5和3的两个地区Rutland和Westminster，基于耦合协调分析研究三种干预策略的影响。结果显示，Rutland农村地区的最佳干预策略为“人类友好策略”，其人类健康指数得分提高了10%；Westminster地区的最佳干预策略为资源友好策略，其总体得分从50.0080提高到了59.6481。

Finally, we evaluated the sensitivity analysis by adjusting the parameter 𝑟 of the environmental part of the LPA model up or down by 5%, and the results showed that our pollution quantification model was more resistant to interference. Afterwards, we created a flyer to inform people in the Westminster area of the UK about the effects of light pollution and the options and benefits of implementing a lighting curfew
最后，我们通过将 LPA 模型环境部分的参数 𝑟 上调或下调 5% 来评估敏感性分析，结果表明我们的污染量化模型更能抵抗干扰。之后，我们制作了一份传单，向英国威斯敏斯特地区的人们介绍光污染的影响以及实施照明宵禁的选择和好处
