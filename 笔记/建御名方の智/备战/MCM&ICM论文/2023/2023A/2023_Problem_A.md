# Background
Different species of plants react to stresses in different ways. For example, grasslands are quite sensitive to drought. Droughts occur at varying frequencies and varying levels of severity. Numerous observations suggest that the number of different species present plays a role in how a plant community adapts when exposed to cycles of drought over successive generations. In some communities with only one species of plant, the generations that follow are not as well adapted to drought conditions as the individual plants in communities with four or more species. These observations raise many questions. For example, what is the minimal number of species necessary for a plant community to benefit from this type of localized biodiversity? How does this phenomenon scale as the number of species increases? What does this imply for the longterm survivability of a plant community?

不同种类的植物对压力有不同的反应。例如，草地对干旱相当敏感。干旱发生的频率和严重程度各不相同。大量观察结果表明，植物群落在连续几代的干旱周期中如何适应干旱，==不同物种的数量起着决定性作用==。在一些只有一种植物的群落中，后代对干旱条件的适应能力不如有四种或更多物种的群落中的单株植物。这些观察结果提出了许多问题。例如，植物群落从这种局部生物多样性中获益所需的==最低物种数量==是多少？这种现象如何随着物种数量的增加而扩大？这对植物群落的长期生存能力意味着什么？

# Requirement
Considering the relationship of drought adaptability with respect to the number of species in a plant community, your task is to explore and better understand this phenomenon. Specifically, you should:

考虑到干旱适应性与植物群落中物种数量的关系，您的任务是探索并更好地理解这一现象。具体来说，你们应该:

- Develop a mathematical model to predict how a plant community changes over time as it is exposed to various irregular weather cycles. Include times of drought when precipitation should be abundant. The model should account for interactions between different species during cycles of drought.

建立数学模型，==预测==植物群落在各种不规则天气周期下如何随时间发生变化。包括降水应该充沛的干旱时期。模型应考虑干旱周期中不同物种之间的相互作用。

- Explore what conclusions you can draw from your model with respect to the long-term interactions of a community of plants and the larger environment. Consider the following questions:
	- How many different plant species are required for the community to benefit and what happens as the number of species grows?(需要==多少种不同的植物物种==才能使群落受益？)
	- How do the types of species in the community impact your results?(群落中的物种类型对结果有何影响？)
	- What are the impact of a greater frequency and wider variation of the occurrence of droughts in future weather cycles? If droughts are less frequent, does the number of species have the same impact on the overall population?(在未来的天气周期中，干旱发生的频率更高、变化更大会产生什么影响？如果干旱发生的频率降低，物种数量对整个种群的影响是否相同？)
	- How do other factors such as pollution and habitat reduction impact your conclusions?(污染和栖息地减少等其他因素对您的结论有何影响？)
	- What does your model indicate should be done to ensure the long-term viability of a plant community and what are the impacts on the larger environment?(您的模型表明应采取哪些措施来确保植物群落的长期生存能力，以及对更大的环境有何影响？)
