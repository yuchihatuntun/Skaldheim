# Summary
The species richness of plant communities has a significant influence on their ability to withstand drought. From an ecological niche perspective, we simulate plant community succession under drought conditions and analyze the effects of various factors.
植物群落的物种丰富度对其抵御干旱的能力有重要影响。我们从生态位角度出发，模拟干旱条件下的植物群落演替，并分析各种因素的影响。

First, we develop the Plant Community Succession Model based on niche theory to simulate community succession under drought conditions. The model applies changes in niche width as the indicator to simulate community succession and utilizes competition matrix to describe interactions between species, including competition and facilitation. Then, the Niche Width Model is established, comprehensively considering the effects of reproduction, mortality, and uncertainties. Among them, reproduction depends on the degree of drought, niche width, interspecific relationships, and environmental capacity, while mortality depends on the degree of drought and the niche width. Uncertainties are measured with Gaussian white noise.
首先，我们基于生态位理论建立了==植物群落演替模型==，以模拟干旱条件下的群落演替。该模型以生态位宽度的变化为指标来模拟群落演替，并利用竞争矩阵来描述物种之间的相互作用，包括竞争和促进。然后，综合考虑繁殖、死亡和不确定性的影响，建立了生态位宽度模型。其中，繁殖取决于干旱程度、生态位宽度、种间关系和环境容量，而死亡则取决于干旱程度和生态位宽度。不确定性用高斯白噪声测量。

A niche width differential equation model is built based on the Beverton-Holt and the LotkaVolterra equations. To account for various irregular weather cycles, we utilize random variables obeying normal distribution to simulate the extent and duration of drought. As a case study, we simulate the evolution of a three-species community and draw the conclusion that the total niche width of the community increases, suggesting long-term survival.
根据贝弗顿-霍尔特方程和洛特卡-沃尔特拉方程，我们建立了一个利基宽度微分方程模型。为了考虑各种不规则的天气周期，我们利用服从正态分布的随机变量来模拟干旱的程度和持续时间。作为案例研究，我们模拟了一个三物种群落的演化过程，并得出结论：群落的总生态位宽度增加，表明群落可以长期生存。

To investigate the influence of species number on community dynamics, we utilize the Plant Community Evolution Model to simulate communities containing one to four species separately. The results demonstrate that three species are necessary for the community to benefit. Additionally, as the number of species increases, the drought resistance improves and then stabilizes.
为了研究物种数量对群落动态的影响，我们利用植物群落演化模型分别模拟了包含一到四个物种的群落。结果表明，三个物种是群落获益的必要条件。此外，随着物种数量的增加，抗旱性也会提高，然后趋于稳定。

Based on the competition matrix, we set up three distinct communities and discuss their drought resistance through simulations. It can be concluded that facilitation-dominated relationships enhance drought resistance and increase the community’s survival time. Moreover, we vary the frequency and intensity of drought and then conclude that species extinction is more likely to occur during severe droughts.
根据竞争矩阵，我们建立了三个不同的群落，并通过模拟讨论了它们的抗旱性。可以得出结论：以促进为主的关系增强了群落的抗旱能力，延长了群落的存活时间。此外，我们还改变了干旱的频率和强度，然后得出结论：在严重干旱期间，物种灭绝的可能性更大。

Pollution and habitat shrinkage affect plant communities’ niche width and competitive relationships. Therefore, we adjust the niche width and competition matrix accordingly. The results indicate that pollution and habitat shrinkage may cause the extinction of certain species.
污染和生境萎缩会影响植物群落的生态位宽度和竞争关系。因此，我们相应地调整了生态位宽度和竞争矩阵。结果表明，污染和生境萎缩可能会导致某些物种灭绝。

Finally, based on the impact of various factors, we recommend some measures to ensure the long-term viability of a plant community. Additionally, we also analyze the significance of protecting vulnerable communities for the overall health of ecosystems.
最后，根据各种因素的影响，我们提出了一些确保植物群落长期生存的措施。此外，我们还分析了保护脆弱群落对生态系统整体健康的意义。
