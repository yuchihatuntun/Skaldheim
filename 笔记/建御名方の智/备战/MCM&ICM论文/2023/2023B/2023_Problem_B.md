# Background
Kenya’s wildlife preserves were originally created primarily to protect wildlife and other naturalresources. Kenya’s parliament passed the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act, 2013 toprovide more equitable sharing of resources, as well as to allow alternative, community-basedmanagement efforts[1]. Kenya has since added amendments to address gaps in the legislation toprovide more clear governance, finance, and penalties for violators[2].
肯尼亚建立野生动物保护区的初衷主要是为了保护野生动物和其他自然资源。肯尼亚议会于 2013 年通过了《野生动物保护和管理法》，以便更公平地分享资源，并允许以社区为基础的替代性管理工作。此后，肯尼亚又增加了一些修正案，以弥补立法中的不足，从而提供更明确的治理、资金和对违法者的处罚。

# Requirement
Focusing on one large game preserve, the Maasai Mara, your task is to determine alternate ways to manage the resources within and outside the current boundaries of the park. Specifically, you should:
以一个大型野生动物保护区马赛马拉为重点，你们的任务是==确定管理公园内外资源的替代方法==。具体来说，你们应该

- Consider and recommend specific policies and management strategies for different areas within the current preserve that will protect wildlife and other natural resources while also balancing the interests of the people who live in the area. These policies and strategies should help mitigate the impacts of lost opportunities experienced by the people who live near the preserve, as well as minimize negative interactions between animals and the people attracted to the preserve.
	考虑并建议当前保护区内不同区域的具体政策和管理策略，以保护野生动物和其他自然资源，同时平衡该地区居民的利益。这些政策和战略应有助于减轻保护区附近居民因失去机会而受到的影响，并最大限度地减少动物与被吸引到保护区的居民之间的负面互动。

• Develop and describe a methodology to determine which policies and management strategies will result in the best outcomes. Your report should discuss how to rank and compare outcomes from your methodology. Be sure to include descriptions and analyses of the models used to predict the interactions between animals and people, as well as the resulting economic impacts in the area within and around the preserve.
	制定并描述一种方法，以确定哪些政策和管理策略将产生最佳结果。您的报告应讨论如何根据您的方法对结果进行排序和比较。请务必说明和分析用于预测动物与人类之间互动的模型，以及由此对保护区内部和周边地区产生的经济影响。

• Given your proposed plan, provide predictions about the long-term trends that will result from your recommendations. Analyze and provide estimates of the certainties and impacts of the possible long-term outcomes. You should also describe how your approach could be applied to other wildlife management areas.
	根据您提出的计划，预测您的建议将产生的长期趋势。分析并估计可能出现的长期结果的确定性和影响。您还应说明如何将您的方法应用于其他野生动物管理区。

Finally, provide a two-page non-technical report for the Kenyan Tourism and Wildlife Committee discussing your proposed plan and its value for the preserve.
