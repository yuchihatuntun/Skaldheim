The New York Times website directions for Wordle state that the color of the tiles will change after you submit your word. A yellow tile indicates the letter in that tile is in the word, but it is in the wrong location. A green tile indicates that the letter in that tile is in the word and is in the correct location. A gray tile indicates that the letter in that tile is not included in the word at all (see Attachment 2)[2]. Figure 1 is an example solution where the correct result was found in three tries
