##### T1: China has announced that it will allow couples to have up to three children. To what extent will this policy boost birth rates? Provide reasons to support your answer (分析三孩政策对生育率的影响)

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **China's three-child policy and its impact on birth rates** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **this policy, on its own, is unlikely to significantly boost the nation's birth rates due to deep-seated socio-economic reasons.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **the prohibitive (high) economic cost of raising children in modern China.**
>
>To be specific, **for many urban families, the financial burdens of housing, healthcare, and particularly education are already immense.** For instance, **the intense competition in education forces parents to invest heavily in extracurricular activities for even one child, making the idea of stretching these finite resources for a third child financially unfeasible.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **the profound shift in social norms and individual aspirations.**
>
>This can be seen in **how many young people today prioritize their careers and personal freedom over the traditional value of having a large family.** A clear example of this is **the "motherhood penalty," where many women are reluctant to have more children for fear of sacrificing their career progression in a society with insufficient childcare support.**

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend/policy could lead to **a situation where China's demographic crisis, including an aging population and a shrinking workforce, continues to worsen despite the relaxed policy, potentially leading to long-term economic stagnation.**
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that **the policy is a necessary first step to remove legal restrictions and signals the government's serious attention to the population issue. It will help a small fraction of couples who already wished for a third child.** However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **the prohibitive economic cost of child-rearing** and **the fundamental shift in social values**, I maintain my position that **the three-child policy by itself will have a very limited impact on actually boosting birth rates.**
>
>Therefore, the path forward is not to simply accept or reject **this policy**, but to **accompany it with a comprehensive package of substantive supporting measures, such as financial subsidies, affordable childcare, and stronger protections for working mothers.** It is crucial that we focus on maximizing its benefits while actively managing its risks.

##### T5: Xinhua News Agency reports that the market for plastic surgery in China is expected to grow to US$46 billion by 2022. Is it a positive or negative trend? Provide reasons to support your answer

> [!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
> The issue of **the booming plastic surgery market in China** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society.
>
> This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
> After careful consideration, I believe that **this trend is largely negative, because its societal and health-related harms far outweigh its individual benefits.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **that it promotes a very narrow and often harmful standard of beauty.**
>
>To be specific, **social media and advertising constantly push a single type of look—often called the "internet-celebrity face"—which makes many young people feel anxious and insecure about their own natural appearance.** For instance, **we see a growing number of people pursuing the exact same features, like a high-bridged nose or unnaturally large eyes, which erodes individuality and aesthetic diversity.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **that the explosive growth of this market has led to serious health and safety risks.**
>
>This can be seen in **how the huge demand has outpaced effective government regulation. This has resulted in a large number of unlicensed clinics and unqualified practitioners operating illegally.** A clear example of this is **that news reports frequently expose tragic stories of botched surgeries that cause permanent damage or even death, highlighting the real dangers that many vulnerable consumers face.**

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend/policy could lead to **a society where more and more people, especially the youth, suffer from low self-esteem and body image issues. It risks creating a vicious cycle where individuals constantly feel the need to "fix" themselves to meet an impossible and uniform standard.**
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that **for a small group of people, such as accident victims or those with congenital defects, corrective plastic surgery can be a very positive and life-changing tool to rebuild confidence.** However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **the promotion of toxic beauty standards** and **the severe public health risks**, I maintain my position that **the widespread social anxiety and physical dangers associated with this trend make it more of a problem than a solution for our society.**
>
>Therefore, the path forward is not to simply accept or reject **this trend**, but to **actively promote more diverse beauty standards in our media and education, and for the government to enforce much stricter regulations on the entire industry to protect its citizens.** It is crucial that we focus on maximizing its benefits while actively managing its risks.

##### T6: Do you think today’s college students spend too much time on the social media? Why is that? What are the possible benefits and risks?

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **whether today's college students spend too much time on social media** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society and modern education.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **while social media offers some benefits, the time spent is often excessive, and the risks to mental health and productivity are becoming increasingly serious.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **that social media, despite its risks, serves as an essential tool for information access and social connection for students.**
>
>To be specific, **students use these platforms to stay updated on news, join academic discussion groups, and maintain contact with friends and family, which is crucial for their support system.** For instance, **a student might be in a WeChat or WhatsApp group for a class project while also following experts in their field on other platforms, showing its dual role in social and academic life.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **the serious negative impact that excessive use can have on mental health and academic focus.**
>
>This can be seen in **how the curated, perfect lives displayed online can lead to social comparison, anxiety, and a "Fear of Missing Out," or FOMO. The endless scrolling is also a major distraction from deep work.** A clear example of this is **that numerous studies have shown a correlation between high social media usage and increased rates of depression. Also, many students find they've lost hours to apps like TikTok when they should have been studying.**

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend/policy could lead to **a generation with shorter attention spans and potentially weaker face-to-face communication skills. The constant need for online validation could also negatively affect long-term self-esteem.**
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that **in today's world, a certain amount of social media engagement is almost necessary for networking, joining communities, and even for professional development.** However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **its role as a vital tool for connection** and **its serious risks to mental well-being and productivity**, I maintain my position that **for many students, the balance has tipped too far, where the excessive time spent online results in more harm than good.**
>
>Therefore, the path forward is not to simply accept or reject **social media**, but to **actively develop better 'digital wellness' habits. It is crucial that we focus on using these platforms more consciously, for example by setting time limits, and prioritizing real-life interactions.** It is crucial that we focus on maximizing its benefits while actively managing its risks.

##### T7: Many young college students are suffering from depression. What are the possible causes? What would you suggest to deal with college depression?  

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **the rising issue of depression among college students** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **this is a serious problem caused by multiple interwoven factors, and tackling it requires a combination of individual coping strategies and stronger institutional support from universities.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **the intense and unprecedented academic and career pressure that students face today.**
>
>To be specific, **students are not only stressed about exams and maintaining a high GPA, but they also feel immense anxiety about finding a good job in a highly competitive market after graduation.** For instance, **a student might feel overwhelmed trying to balance difficult coursework with the pressure to secure internships, leading to burnout and feelings of hopelessness.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **a growing sense of social isolation, which is often made worse by social media.**
>
>This can be seen in **how students, despite being digitally connected, may lack deep, meaningful real-life interactions. Social media often contributes to feelings of inadequacy through constant social comparison.** A clear example of this is **a student seeing curated, "perfect" lives of their peers online, which can make them feel like their own life is not good enough, contributing directly to depressive symptoms.**

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend/policy could lead to **a generation of young adults entering the workforce with significant mental health challenges, affecting their long-term well-being, productivity, and placing a heavy burden on the public health system.**
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that **a certain amount of stress is a normal part of life and can even be a motivator for achievement. The problem isn't the existence of stress, but when it becomes chronic and overwhelming without adequate support.** However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **the immense pressure from academics and career uncertainty** and **the growing sense of social isolation**, I maintain my position that **depression among students is a critical issue that demands a multi-faceted solution, combining both personal effort and strong institutional support.**
>
>Therefore, the path forward is not to simply accept or reject **this mental health challenge**, but to **encourage students to proactively seek help and practice self-care, while simultaneously calling on universities to invest more in accessible, non-stigmatized mental health services like counseling and wellness programs.** It is crucial that we focus on maximizing its benefits while actively managing its risks.

>
> Specifically, I was most impressed by **the scene of the first atomic bomb test, known as the Trinity Test**.

This scientific accuracy makes the moment feel incredibly real and terrifying**.
