##### T1: China has announced that it will allow couples to have up to three children. To what extent will this policy boost birth rates? Provide reasons to support your answer (分析三孩政策对生育率的影响)

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **China's three-child policy and its impact on birth rates** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **this policy, on its own, is unlikely to significantly boost the nation's birth rates due to deep-seated socio-economic reasons.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **the prohibitive (high) economic cost of raising children in modern China.**
>
>To be specific, **for many urban families, the financial burdens of housing, healthcare, and particularly education are already immense.** For instance, **the intense competition in education forces parents to invest heavily in extracurricular activities for even one child, making the idea of stretching these finite resources for a third child financially unfeasible.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **the major change in what young people want from life today.**
>
>This can be seen in **how today's young people care more about their jobs and personal freedom than having many children.** A clear example of this is **that many women worry that having more children will hurt their career chances, especially when there isn't enough help with childcare.**

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **the high cost of raising children** and **the major change in what young people want from life**, I maintain my position that **the three-child policy by itself will not greatly increase China's birth rates.**

##### T5: Xinhua News Agency reports that the market for plastic surgery in China is expected to grow to US$46 billion by 2022. Is it a positive or negative trend? Provide reasons to support your answer（膨胀的整容市场）

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **China's growing plastic surgery market** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **this trend is mostly bad for society because the dangers and problems it creates are much bigger than any benefits it might bring.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **that the plastic surgery boom creates unhealthy beauty standards.**
>
>To be specific, **social media and ads keep showing the same "perfect" look, which makes many young people feel bad about how they naturally look.** For instance, **more and more people want the exact same features, like a thin nose or big eyes, which means everyone starts looking the same instead of being unique.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **that this fast-growing industry has created serious safety problems.**
>
>This can be seen in **how there are now many illegal clinics and fake doctors because the government can't control everything that's happening so quickly.** A clear example of this is **that we often hear terrible news stories about surgeries that go wrong and hurt people badly or even kill them, showing how dangerous this trend can be.**

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **the promotion of toxic beauty standards** and **the severe public health risks**, I maintain my position that **the widespread social anxiety and physical dangers associated with this trend make it more of a problem than a solution for our society.**

##### T6: Do you think today’s college students spend too much time on the social media? Why is that? What are the possible benefits and risks?（使用过多社交媒体）

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **whether today's college students spend too much time on social media** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **while social media has some good points, most students spend way too much time on it, and this is causing serious problems for their mental health and studies.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **that social media can be helpful for students to get information and stay connected with others.**
>
>To be specific, **students use these apps to read news, join study groups, and talk with friends and family, which helps them feel supported and connected.** For instance, **a student might be in a WeChat group for homework help while also following teachers or experts on other apps, showing how it can be useful for both social life and learning.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **that spending too much time on social media can really hurt students' mental health and ability to focus on schoolwork.**
>
>This can be seen in **how seeing other people's "perfect" lives online makes many students feel bad about themselves and worry they're missing out on something. Also, scrolling through apps for hours stops them from focusing on important work.** A clear example of this is **that many studies show that students who use social media a lot are more likely to feel depressed. Plus, lots of students realize they've wasted hours on apps like TikTok when they should have been studying.**

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **social media's helpful role in keeping people connected** and **its serious harm to mental health and school performance**, I maintain my position that **most students are spending too much time online, and this is causing more problems than benefits.**

##### T7: Many young college students are suffering from depression. What are the possible causes? What would you suggest to deal with college depression?  

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **depression becoming more common among college students** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **this is a serious problem caused by many different reasons working together, and solving it requires both students learning to cope better and universities providing more support.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **the huge stress from schoolwork and worrying about finding jobs after graduation.**
>
>To be specific, **students feel stressed not just about tests and getting good grades, but also about whether they can find a good job in today's tough job market.** For instance, **a student might feel completely overwhelmed trying to handle difficult classes while also trying to get internships, which can lead to feeling burned out and hopeless.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **that many students feel lonely and disconnected from others, and social media often makes this worse.**
>
>This can be seen in **how students might have many online friends but lack close, real friendships in person. Social media makes students compare themselves to others all the time.** A clear example of this is **when students see other people's "perfect" lives online, they start feeling like their own life isn't good enough, which directly leads to feeling depressed.**

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **the huge pressure from school and job worries** and **the growing problem of loneliness**, I maintain my position that **depression among students is a serious problem that needs different types of solutions, including both students learning better ways to handle stress and schools providing more help.**

##### T8: While ChatGPT or DeepSeek is becoming increasingly popular these days, it also poses risks and challenges. What are the major challenges it will pose to the college students? Do you think it should be banned in colleges? Why?（大学生使用人工智能）

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **students using AI tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek in college** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our education system.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **these tools should not be banned, but colleges need to make clear rules about how students can use them.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **that AI tools can make students cheat and stop them from really learning.**
>
>To be specific, **many students might ask ChatGPT to write their homework or essays instead of doing the work themselves. This means they don't actually learn how to think or write, which are very important skills for their jobs later.** For instance, **a student could turn in a great-looking paper that was completely written by AI, but when they go to job interviews or start working, they won't know how to do things properly.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **that completely stopping students from using these tools would be impossible and would actually hurt their chances of success later.**
>
>This can be seen in **how AI is now used in many workplaces. Students need to learn the right way to use these tools, not be kept away from them completely.** A clear example of this is **that many companies now expect their workers to know how to use AI tools well. If colleges ban them completely, students will finish school without knowing how to work in today's world.**

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **the danger of cheating and not learning properly** and **the need to prepare students for jobs that use AI**, I maintain my position that **the answer is not to ban these tools, but to teach students the right way to use them.**

##### T9: What environmental problems have you noticed in everyday life? What are the causes and consequences of these problems? What can we do as individuals to protect the environment?

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **environmental problems we face in our daily lives** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **while these problems are severe and caused by large-scale factors, individual actions, when multiplied, can play a meaningful role in creating a sustainable future.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **that I notice serious pollution problems every day in my city.**
>
>To be specific, **the air quality is often poor, especially during winter when many people burn coal for heating. I also see a lot of plastic waste in rivers and on streets, and many people still throw trash anywhere they want.** For instance, **when I walk to school, I often see the sky covered with thick smog, and I have to wear a mask to protect myself from breathing dirty air.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **that these problems are mainly caused by our modern lifestyle and lack of environmental awareness.**
>
>This can be seen in **how people buy too many things they don't really need, use cars instead of walking or biking, and many factories still pollute water and air to save money.** A clear example of this is **that most people in my neighborhood drive cars even for very short trips, and many stores still give out plastic bags for everything, creating huge amounts of unnecessary waste.**

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **the daily pollution I observe** and **the lifestyle choices that cause these problems**, I maintain my position that **we all have a responsibility to protect our environment, even if our individual actions seem small.**

##### T10: Online education is getting more and more popular all over the world. Do you think it will replace on-campus education one day? Why or why not?

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **whether online education will replace traditional on-campus education** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our education system.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **online education will not completely replace the on-campus experience, but will instead evolve into an essential and complementary tool within a hybrid learning model.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **that online education lacks the important human connections and social experiences that make college special.**
>
>To be specific, **while you can learn facts and skills online, it's much harder to build friendships, work in teams, or get personal guidance from teachers through a computer screen.** For instance, **a chemistry student might watch lab experiments online, but they can't actually touch the equipment or work with classmates to solve problems together, which are key parts of real learning.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **that online education actually works best when it's combined with traditional classroom learning.**
>
>This can be seen in **how many successful online courses now include live video calls, group projects, and even occasional in-person meetings. Students can watch lectures at home but still meet with classmates for discussions.** A clear example of this is **that during COVID-19, the most effective schools didn't just move everything online - they found creative ways to mix online tools with real human interaction.**

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **the importance of human connections in learning** and **the success of combining online and offline methods**, I maintain my position that **the future of education lies in smart combination of both approaches rather than one completely replacing the other.**

##### T15: The U.S. government's recent tariff threats have sparked widespread criticism. What is your comment on the recent tariff war? How does it impact the U.S. and China?

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **the recent trade war between the U.S. and China** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in world trade.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **this trade war is bad for everyone and hurts both countries' economies as well as businesses around the world.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **that these trade taxes make things more expensive for regular people in both countries.**
>
>To be specific, **when the U.S. puts extra taxes on Chinese products, American companies and people end up paying more money for things like phones, clothes, and household items. When China does the same thing back, Chinese people have to pay more for American products.** For instance, **a phone that used to cost $500 might now cost $600 because of these extra taxes, which means families have less money left over for other important things.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **that this trade war messes up the way companies around the world work together.**
>
>This can be seen in **how many companies need parts from both countries to make their products. When extra taxes make these parts cost more, it hurts businesses everywhere.** A clear example of this is **that a car company might use Chinese steel and American computer parts to build cars in Mexico. When taxes make everything more expensive, the company might have to charge more for cars or fire workers, which hurts people in all three countries.**

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **higher prices for everyday people** and **problems for businesses worldwide**, I maintain my position that **the trade war creates more problems than it fixes and hurts both the U.S. and China.**

>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **AI has both good and bad sides, and we need to be very careful about how we use it to get the benefits while avoiding the problems.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **that AI can help us in many wonderful ways in our everyday lives.**
>
>To be specific, **AI can help doctors find illnesses more quickly and correctly, help students learn better through programs that fit their needs, and make our work easier by doing boring tasks for us.** For instance, **AI translation apps like Google Translate have made it much easier for people who speak different languages to talk to each other, solving communication problems that existed for hundreds of years.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **that AI also brings serious dangers that we must worry about.**
>
>This can be seen in **how AI might take away many people's jobs, causing them to lose work, and how bad people can use it to spread lies or spy on others.** A clear example of this is **that some AI can make fake videos of people saying things they never really said, which could hurt their reputation or trick people during important times like elections.**

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **AI's amazing ability to make our lives better** and **its serious dangers to jobs and society**, I maintain my position that **we need to be smart about AI - we should use its good parts while being very careful about the bad parts.**

> [!note] 描述细节（Description & Details）

> To give you some context, **'Oppenheimer' is best known for its unique narrative structure, which jumps between different timelines to tell its story. This isn't just for style; it constantly forces the audience to connect the scientific achievements with their political consequences**.
>
> Specifically, I was most impressed by **the scene of the first atomic bomb test, known as the Trinity Test**. For example: **The film builds incredible tension by using complete silence for a long time. Then, we see the blinding flash of light first, long before we hear the deafening sound. This scientific accuracy makes the moment feel incredibly real and terrifying**.

> [!note] 解释情感（Explanation & Emotion）
>
> But the real reason why I find it so impressive is **its deep focus on the moral dilemma of its main character. It's not just a history lesson; it's a very human story**.

> Specifically, I was most impressed by **his determination to play in the 2008 Beijing Olympics**. For example: **Despite suffering a career-threatening foot injury just months before the games, he went through intense rehabilitation to make sure he could represent his country on home soil. The moment he walked into the stadium leading Team China was iconic**.

> [!note] 解释情感（Explanation & Emotion）

##### T14: Prepare a speech entitled "The importance of the rich helping the poor in a harmonious society."

> [!note] 挂钩与标题（Hook & Headline）
>
> **What kind of society do we really want to live in - one where a few people keep all the money, or one where everyone gets a fair chance**? This is a question that touches upon a core issue in our society today: **the growing gap between rich and poor people**.
>
> Today, I want to share my thoughts with you. I firmly believe that **rich people should help poor people because this is the right thing to do and it makes society better for everyone**.

> [!note] 证据与情感（Evidence & Emotion）
>
> Let's first look at the facts. The main reason we should support this idea is that **when there's a huge gap between rich and poor, it causes serious problems for everyone**.
>
> For example, studies show that **countries with big gaps between rich and poor have more crime, more social problems, and less stability. Research also shows that when poor people have more money to spend, it helps the economy grow, which benefits everyone, including rich people**. This clearly shows that **helping poor people isn't just being nice - it's smart business that makes life better for all of us**.
>
> But this isn't just about numbers and facts; it's about people and what we believe is right. Think about this story: **A successful business owner grew up very poor. Through education and hard work, she built a great company. Now, she uses her money to pay for poor children to go to school, knowing that one of them might become the next great inventor, doctor, or teacher**.
>
> This story shows **that when we help others succeed, we create a circle of opportunity that makes our whole society better**. It speaks to our feelings of **kindness, fairness, and caring about each other**.

##### T16: South Korea is one of the largest markets for men's cosmetics. Some reports suggest that these Korean men use makeup in order to get ahead in job competitions. Should men apply makeup? Does makeup make men less masculine? What do you think?

> [!note] 挂钩与标题（Hook & Headline）
>
> **What does it really mean to be a man today - should men follow old rules about how they should look, or should they be free to make choices that help them succeed**? This is a question that touches upon a core issue in our society today: **how we think about what men and women should do**.
>
> Today, I want to share my thoughts with you. I firmly believe that **men should be free to use makeup if they want to, and this doesn't make them less manly - it shows they are confident and smart about adapting to the modern world**.

> [!note] 证据与情感（Evidence & Emotion）
>
> Let's first look at the facts. The main reason we should support this idea is that **throughout history, ideas about how men should look have always changed, and makeup has often been normal for men**.
>
> For example, studies show that **in ancient Egypt, both men and women wore makeup for protection and to show their status. Even today, male actors, singers, and famous people use makeup for their work. In South Korea, men spend billions of dollars on cosmetics, showing this is not just a small trend but a big change in society**. This clearly shows that **makeup is not just for women - it's simply a tool to help people look and feel their best**.
>
> But this is not just about facts and logic; it's about people and what we believe is right. Think about this story: **Imagine a young man getting ready for his dream job interview. He has worked hard for years, but he feels worried about some acne scars on his face. By using a little makeup to cover them, he walks into that interview feeling confident and can focus on showing his skills instead of worrying about how he looks**.
>
> This story shows **that makeup can help people feel more confident and present themselves better to the world**. It speaks to our feelings of **fairness, personal freedom, and the right to make choices about our own lives**.

>

##### T12: Role-play: You're talking to a friend who thinks vaping is cool. Share one fact and one suggestion to help them think differently.

> [!note] 情境设定（Situation & Setting）
>
> Let me set the scene for you. In this scenario, I am **talking to my close friend who has recently started vaping** facing **the delicate challenge of expressing concern without being preachy or damaging our friendship**.
>
> The context is **that my friend thinks vaping is a harmless, trendy activity that makes them look cool**, which means I need to **share information that might change their perspective while maintaining a supportive, non-judgmental tone**.


> [!note] 行动与应用（Action & Application）
>
> Here's exactly what I would say: **"Hey, I know you've been vaping recently, and I'm not here to lecture you - I just care about you and wanted to share something I learned. Did you know that one vape pod can contain as much nicotine as an entire pack of cigarettes? I was really surprised when I found that out because vaping is marketed as being so much 'lighter' than smoking."**
>
> Specifically, I would **continue with genuine concern: "I totally get that it seems less harmful and way more socially acceptable, but the nicotine addiction can develop just as quickly. I've seen some of our classmates who started vaping casually but now feel like they need it to get through the day."**
>
> Additionally, I would **offer a practical suggestion: "I'm not asking you to quit immediately, but maybe you could try keeping track of how often you vape for a week? Just to see if it's becoming more of a habit than you realized. And if you ever want to try cutting back, I'd be happy to hang out more often as a distraction - we could go to the gym or try that new coffee shop instead."**

> [!note] 结果与反思（Result & Reflection）
>
> The expected outcome of this approach would be **that my friend feels supported rather than judged, and they have concrete information to consider along with a practical way to assess their own usage**.

##### T13: Your school has launched a "10-Yuan Challenge" to improve money management skills. As a participant, plan your day using only 10 yuan and share your reflections.

> Let me set the scene for you. In this scenario, I am **a student participating in my school's "10-Yuan Challenge"** facing **the challenge of planning an entire day's expenses with only 10 yuan to understand the value of money and budgeting**.
>
> The context is **that this exercise is designed to teach us practical money management skills and help us appreciate the importance of careful financial planning**, which means I need to **make strategic choices about how to allocate this limited budget while still meeting my basic needs**.

> [!note] 行动与应用（Action & Application）
>
> Here's exactly what I would do: **I would start by making a priority list and budget plan. My essential needs are: breakfast (2 yuan for steamed buns), lunch (4 yuan for a simple meal in the school cafeteria), and bus fare home (2 yuan), leaving me with 2 yuan for unexpected expenses or a small snack**.
>
> Specifically, I would **skip my usual morning coffee shop visit and bring water from home instead of buying drinks. For lunch, I'd choose the most economical option in the cafeteria rather than my preferred meal**. For example, **instead of my usual 8-yuan lunch combo, I'd get plain rice with one vegetable dish for 4 yuan, and I'd walk to school instead of taking the bus there to save 2 yuan**.
>
> Additionally, I would **use creative strategies like borrowing a book from the library instead of buying magazines, and meeting friends at the park instead of going to a café**. This would involve **finding free or low-cost entertainment options and discovering that many enjoyable activities don't require spending money**.

> [!note] 结果与反思（Result & Reflection）

> The expected outcome of this approach would be **that I successfully complete the challenge while gaining a deeper appreciation for careful budgeting and the value of money**.
