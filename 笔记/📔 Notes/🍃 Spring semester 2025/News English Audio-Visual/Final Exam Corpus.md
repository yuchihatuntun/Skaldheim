##### T1: China has announced that it will allow couples to have up to three children. To what extent will this policy boost birth rates? Provide reasons to support your answer (分析三孩政策对生育率的影响)

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">China's three-child policy and its impact on birth rates</span> has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">this policy, on its own, is unlikely to significantly boost the nation's birth rates due to deep-seated socio-economic reasons.</span>

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">the prohibitive (high) economic cost of raising children in modern China.</span>
>
>To be specific, <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">for many urban families, the financial burdens of housing, healthcare, and particularly education are already immense.</span> For instance, <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">the intense competition in education forces parents to invest heavily in extracurricular activities for even one child, making the idea of stretching these finite resources for a third child financially unfeasible.</span>
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">the profound shift in social norms and individual aspirations.</span>
>
>This can be seen in <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">how many young people today prioritize their careers and personal freedom over the traditional value of having a large family.</span> A clear example of this is <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">the "motherhood penalty," where many women are reluctant to have more children for fear of sacrificing their career progression in a society with insufficient childcare support.</span>

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend/policy could lead to <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">a situation where China's demographic crisis, including an aging population and a shrinking workforce, continues to worsen despite the relaxed policy, potentially leading to long-term economic stagnation.</span>
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">the policy is a necessary first step to remove legal restrictions and signals the government's serious attention to the population issue. It will help a small fraction of couples who already wished for a third child.</span> However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">the prohibitive economic cost of child-rearing</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">the fundamental shift in social values</span>, I maintain my position that <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">the three-child policy by itself will have a very limited impact on actually boosting birth rates.</span>
>
>Therefore, the path forward is not to simply accept or reject <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">this policy</span>, but to <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">accompany it with a comprehensive package of substantive supporting measures, such as financial subsidies, affordable childcare, and stronger protections for working mothers.</span> It is crucial that we focus on maximizing its benefits while actively managing its risks.

##### T5: Xinhua News Agency reports that the market for plastic surgery in China is expected to grow to US$46 billion by 2022. Is it a positive or negative trend? Provide reasons to support your answer

> [!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
> The issue of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">the booming plastic surgery market in China</span> has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society.
>
> This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
> After careful consideration, I believe that <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">this trend is largely negative, because its societal and health-related harms far outweigh its individual benefits.</span>

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">that it promotes a very narrow and often harmful standard of beauty.</span>
>
>To be specific, <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">social media and advertising constantly push a single type of look—often called the "internet-celebrity face"—which makes many young people feel anxious and insecure about their own natural appearance.</span> For instance, <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">we see a growing number of people pursuing the exact same features, like a high-bridged nose or unnaturally large eyes, which erodes individuality and aesthetic diversity.</span>
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">that the explosive growth of this market has led to serious health and safety risks.</span>
>
>This can be seen in <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">how the huge demand has outpaced effective government regulation. This has resulted in a large number of unlicensed clinics and unqualified practitioners operating illegally.</span> A clear example of this is <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">that news reports frequently expose tragic stories of botched surgeries that cause permanent damage or even death, highlighting the real dangers that many vulnerable consumers face.</span>

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend/policy could lead to <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">a society where more and more people, especially the youth, suffer from low self-esteem and body image issues. It risks creating a vicious cycle where individuals constantly feel the need to "fix" themselves to meet an impossible and uniform standard.</span>
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">for a small group of people, such as accident victims or those with congenital defects, corrective plastic surgery can be a very positive and life-changing tool to rebuild confidence.</span> However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">the promotion of toxic beauty standards</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">the severe public health risks</span>, I maintain my position that <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">the widespread social anxiety and physical dangers associated with this trend make it more of a problem than a solution for our society.</span>
>
>Therefore, the path forward is not to simply accept or reject <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">this trend</span>, but to <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">actively promote more diverse beauty standards in our media and education, and for the government to enforce much stricter regulations on the entire industry to protect its citizens.</span> It is crucial that we focus on maximizing its benefits while actively managing its risks.

##### T6: Do you think today’s college students spend too much time on the social media? Why is that? What are the possible benefits and risks?

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">whether today's college students spend too much time on social media</span> has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society and modern education.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">while social media offers some benefits, the time spent is often excessive, and the risks to mental health and productivity are becoming increasingly serious.</span>

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">that social media, despite its risks, serves as an essential tool for information access and social connection for students.</span>
>
>To be specific, <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">students use these platforms to stay updated on news, join academic discussion groups, and maintain contact with friends and family, which is crucial for their support system.</span> For instance, <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">a student might be in a WeChat or WhatsApp group for a class project while also following experts in their field on other platforms, showing its dual role in social and academic life.</span>
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">the serious negative impact that excessive use can have on mental health and academic focus.</span>
>
>This can be seen in <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">how the curated, perfect lives displayed online can lead to social comparison, anxiety, and a "Fear of Missing Out," or FOMO. The endless scrolling is also a major distraction from deep work.</span> A clear example of this is <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">that numerous studies have shown a correlation between high social media usage and increased rates of depression. Also, many students find they've lost hours to apps like TikTok when they should have been studying.</span>

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend/policy could lead to <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">a generation with shorter attention spans and potentially weaker face-to-face communication skills. The constant need for online validation could also negatively affect long-term self-esteem.</span>
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">in today's world, a certain amount of social media engagement is almost necessary for networking, joining communities, and even for professional development.</span> However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">its role as a vital tool for connection</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">its serious risks to mental well-being and productivity</span>, I maintain my position that <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">for many students, the balance has tipped too far, where the excessive time spent online results in more harm than good.</span>
>
>Therefore, the path forward is not to simply accept or reject <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">social media</span>, but to <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">actively develop better 'digital wellness' habits. It is crucial that we focus on using these platforms more consciously, for example by setting time limits, and prioritizing real-life interactions.</span> It is crucial that we focus on maximizing its benefits while actively managing its risks.

##### T7: Many young college students are suffering from depression. What are the possible causes? What would you suggest to deal with college depression?  

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">the rising issue of depression among college students</span> has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society.

>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">this is a serious problem caused by multiple interwoven factors, and tackling it requires a combination of individual coping strategies and stronger institutional support from universities.</span>

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">the intense and unprecedented academic and career pressure that students face today.</span>
>
>To be specific, <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">students are not only stressed about exams and maintaining a high GPA, but they also feel immense anxiety about finding a good job in a highly competitive market after graduation.</span> For instance, <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">a student might feel overwhelmed trying to balance difficult coursework with the pressure to secure internships, leading to burnout and feelings of hopelessness.</span>
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">a growing sense of social isolation, which is often made worse by social media.</span>
>
>This can be seen in <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">how students, despite being digitally connected, may lack deep, meaningful real-life interactions. Social media often contributes to feelings of inadequacy through constant social comparison.</span> A clear example of this is <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">a student seeing curated, "perfect" lives of their peers online, which can make them feel like their own life is not good enough, contributing directly to depressive symptoms.</span>

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend/policy could lead to <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">a generation of young adults entering the workforce with significant mental health challenges, affecting their long-term well-being, productivity, and placing a heavy burden on the public health system.</span>
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">a certain amount of stress is a normal part of life and can even be a motivator for achievement. The problem isn't the existence of stress, but when it becomes chronic and overwhelming without adequate support.</span> However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.
