##### T1: China has announced that it will allow couples to have up to three children. To what extent will this policy boost birth rates? Provide reasons to support your answer (分析三孩政策对生育率的影响)

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **China's three-child policy and its impact on birth rates** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **this policy, on its own, is unlikely to significantly boost the nation's birth rates due to deep-seated socio-economic reasons.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **the prohibitive (high) economic cost of raising children in modern China.**
>
>To be specific, **for many urban families, the financial burdens of housing, healthcare, and particularly education are already immense.** For instance, **the intense competition in education forces parents to invest heavily in extracurricular activities for even one child, making the idea of stretching these finite resources for a third child financially unfeasible.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **the profound shift in social norms and individual aspirations.**
>
>This can be seen in **how many young people today prioritize their careers and personal freedom over the traditional value of having a large family.** A clear example of this is **the "motherhood penalty," where many women are reluctant to have more children for fear of sacrificing their career progression in a society with insufficient childcare support.**

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend/policy could lead to **a situation where China's demographic crisis, including an aging population and a shrinking workforce, continues to worsen despite the relaxed policy, potentially leading to long-term economic stagnation.**
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that **the policy is a necessary first step to remove legal restrictions and signals the government's serious attention to the population issue. It will help a small fraction of couples who already wished for a third child.** However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **the prohibitive economic cost of child-rearing** and **the fundamental shift in social values**, I maintain my position that **the three-child policy by itself will have a very limited impact on actually boosting birth rates.**
>
>Therefore, the path forward is not to simply accept or reject **this policy**, but to **accompany it with a comprehensive package of substantive supporting measures, such as financial subsidies, affordable childcare, and stronger protections for working mothers.** It is crucial that we focus on maximizing its benefits while actively managing its risks.

##### T5: Xinhua News Agency reports that the market for plastic surgery in China is expected to grow to US$46 billion by 2022. Is it a positive or negative trend? Provide reasons to support your answer

> [!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
> The issue of **the booming plastic surgery market in China** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society.
>
> This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
> After careful consideration, I believe that **this trend is largely negative, because its societal and health-related harms far outweigh its individual benefits.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **that it promotes a very narrow and often harmful standard of beauty.**
>
>To be specific, **social media and advertising constantly push a single type of look—often called the "internet-celebrity face"—which makes many young people feel anxious and insecure about their own natural appearance.** For instance, **we see a growing number of people pursuing the exact same features, like a high-bridged nose or unnaturally large eyes, which erodes individuality and aesthetic diversity.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **that the explosive growth of this market has led to serious health and safety risks.**
>
>This can be seen in **how the huge demand has outpaced effective government regulation. This has resulted in a large number of unlicensed clinics and unqualified practitioners operating illegally.** A clear example of this is **that news reports frequently expose tragic stories of botched surgeries that cause permanent damage or even death, highlighting the real dangers that many vulnerable consumers face.**

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend/policy could lead to **a society where more and more people, especially the youth, suffer from low self-esteem and body image issues. It risks creating a vicious cycle where individuals constantly feel the need to "fix" themselves to meet an impossible and uniform standard.**
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that **for a small group of people, such as accident victims or those with congenital defects, corrective plastic surgery can be a very positive and life-changing tool to rebuild confidence.** However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **the promotion of toxic beauty standards** and **the severe public health risks**, I maintain my position that **the widespread social anxiety and physical dangers associated with this trend make it more of a problem than a solution for our society.**
>
>Therefore, the path forward is not to simply accept or reject **this trend**, but to **actively promote more diverse beauty standards in our media and education, and for the government to enforce much stricter regulations on the entire industry to protect its citizens.** It is crucial that we focus on maximizing its benefits while actively managing its risks.

##### T6: Do you think today’s college students spend too much time on the social media? Why is that? What are the possible benefits and risks?

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **whether today's college students spend too much time on social media** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society and modern education.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **while social media offers some benefits, the time spent is often excessive, and the risks to mental health and productivity are becoming increasingly serious.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **that social media, despite its risks, serves as an essential tool for information access and social connection for students.**
>
>To be specific, **students use these platforms to stay updated on news, join academic discussion groups, and maintain contact with friends and family, which is crucial for their support system.** For instance, **a student might be in a WeChat or WhatsApp group for a class project while also following experts in their field on other platforms, showing its dual role in social and academic life.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **the serious negative impact that excessive use can have on mental health and academic focus.**
>
>This can be seen in **how the curated, perfect lives displayed online can lead to social comparison, anxiety, and a "Fear of Missing Out," or FOMO. The endless scrolling is also a major distraction from deep work.** A clear example of this is **that numerous studies have shown a correlation between high social media usage and increased rates of depression. Also, many students find they've lost hours to apps like TikTok when they should have been studying.**

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend/policy could lead to **a generation with shorter attention spans and potentially weaker face-to-face communication skills. The constant need for online validation could also negatively affect long-term self-esteem.**
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that **in today's world, a certain amount of social media engagement is almost necessary for networking, joining communities, and even for professional development.** However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **its role as a vital tool for connection** and **its serious risks to mental well-being and productivity**, I maintain my position that **for many students, the balance has tipped too far, where the excessive time spent online results in more harm than good.**
>
>Therefore, the path forward is not to simply accept or reject **social media**, but to **actively develop better 'digital wellness' habits. It is crucial that we focus on using these platforms more consciously, for example by setting time limits, and prioritizing real-life interactions.** It is crucial that we focus on maximizing its benefits while actively managing its risks.

##### T7: Many young college students are suffering from depression. What are the possible causes? What would you suggest to deal with college depression?  

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **the rising issue of depression among college students** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **this is a serious problem caused by multiple interwoven factors, and tackling it requires a combination of individual coping strategies and stronger institutional support from universities.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **the intense and unprecedented academic and career pressure that students face today.**
>
>To be specific, **students are not only stressed about exams and maintaining a high GPA, but they also feel immense anxiety about finding a good job in a highly competitive market after graduation.** For instance, **a student might feel overwhelmed trying to balance difficult coursework with the pressure to secure internships, leading to burnout and feelings of hopelessness.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **a growing sense of social isolation, which is often made worse by social media.**
>
>This can be seen in **how students, despite being digitally connected, may lack deep, meaningful real-life interactions. Social media often contributes to feelings of inadequacy through constant social comparison.** A clear example of this is **a student seeing curated, "perfect" lives of their peers online, which can make them feel like their own life is not good enough, contributing directly to depressive symptoms.**

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend/policy could lead to **a generation of young adults entering the workforce with significant mental health challenges, affecting their long-term well-being, productivity, and placing a heavy burden on the public health system.**
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that **a certain amount of stress is a normal part of life and can even be a motivator for achievement. The problem isn't the existence of stress, but when it becomes chronic and overwhelming without adequate support.** However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **the immense pressure from academics and career uncertainty** and **the growing sense of social isolation**, I maintain my position that **depression among students is a critical issue that demands a multi-faceted solution, combining both personal effort and strong institutional support.**
>
>Therefore, the path forward is not to simply accept or reject **this mental health challenge**, but to **encourage students to proactively seek help and practice self-care, while simultaneously calling on universities to invest more in accessible, non-stigmatized mental health services like counseling and wellness programs.** It is crucial that we focus on maximizing its benefits while actively managing its risks.

##### T8: While ChatGPT or DeepSeek is becoming increasingly popular these days, it also poses risks and challenges. What are the major challenges it will pose to the college students? Do you think it should be banned in colleges? Why?

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **the use of powerful AI tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek in colleges** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our education system.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **these tools should not be banned, but instead must be carefully regulated and responsibly integrated into the curriculum.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **that AI tools create serious problems for academic honesty and real learning.**
>
>To be specific, **many students might use ChatGPT to write their essays or solve homework problems without actually understanding the material. This means they miss out on developing critical thinking and writing skills that are essential for their future careers.** For instance, **a student could submit a perfect-looking research paper written entirely by AI, but when they face a job interview or real work situation, they won't have the knowledge or skills they claimed to have.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **that completely banning these tools would be unrealistic and actually harmful to students' future success.**
>
>This can be seen in **how AI is becoming a normal part of many workplaces. Students need to learn how to use these tools properly and ethically, rather than being kept away from them completely.** A clear example of this is **that many companies now expect their employees to know how to work with AI tools effectively. If colleges ban them entirely, students will graduate unprepared for the modern workplace.**

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend could lead to **a generation of students who either become overly dependent on AI without developing their own skills, or who are completely unprepared for a world where AI is everywhere.**
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that **AI tools can be incredibly helpful for learning when used correctly. They can help students understand difficult concepts, practice language skills, or get feedback on their ideas.** However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **the risks to academic integrity and genuine learning** and **the need to prepare students for an AI-integrated future**, I maintain my position that **the solution is not to ban these tools, but to teach students how to use them responsibly and appropriately.**
>
>Therefore, the path forward is not to simply accept or reject **AI in education**, but to **create clear guidelines about when and how students can use AI tools, while focusing on assignments that require original thinking and personal reflection that AI cannot replicate.** It is crucial that we focus on maximizing its benefits while actively managing its risks.

##### T9: What environmental problems have you noticed in everyday life? What are the causes and consequences of these problems? What can we do as individuals to protect the environment?

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **environmental problems we face in our daily lives** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **while these problems are severe and caused by large-scale factors, individual actions, when multiplied, can play a meaningful role in creating a sustainable future.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **that I notice serious pollution problems every day in my city.**
>
>To be specific, **the air quality is often poor, especially during winter when many people burn coal for heating. I also see a lot of plastic waste in rivers and on streets, and many people still throw trash anywhere they want.** For instance, **when I walk to school, I often see the sky covered with thick smog, and I have to wear a mask to protect myself from breathing dirty air.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **that these problems are mainly caused by our modern lifestyle and lack of environmental awareness.**
>
>This can be seen in **how people buy too many things they don't really need, use cars instead of walking or biking, and many factories still pollute water and air to save money.** A clear example of this is **that most people in my neighborhood drive cars even for very short trips, and many stores still give out plastic bags for everything, creating huge amounts of unnecessary waste.**

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend could lead to **serious health problems for everyone, especially children and elderly people. Climate change will also make extreme weather more common, affecting food production and making life harder for future generations.**
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that **big companies and governments need to make the biggest changes, and individual efforts might seem small compared to industrial pollution.** However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **the daily pollution I observe** and **the lifestyle choices that cause these problems**, I maintain my position that **we all have a responsibility to protect our environment, even if our individual actions seem small.**
>
>Therefore, the path forward is not to simply accept or reject **environmental responsibility**, but to **start with simple changes like using less plastic, walking or biking more, saving electricity at home, and properly sorting our garbage. We should also support businesses that care about the environment.** It is crucial that we focus on maximizing our positive impact while actively reducing our environmental footprint.

##### T10: Online education is getting more and more popular all over the world. Do you think it will replace on-campus education one day? Why or why not?

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **whether online education will replace traditional on-campus education** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our education system.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **online education will not completely replace the on-campus experience, but will instead evolve into an essential and complementary tool within a hybrid learning model.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **that online education lacks the important human connections and social experiences that make college special.**
>
>To be specific, **while you can learn facts and skills online, it's much harder to build friendships, work in teams, or get personal guidance from teachers through a computer screen.** For instance, **a chemistry student might watch lab experiments online, but they can't actually touch the equipment or work with classmates to solve problems together, which are key parts of real learning.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **that online education actually works best when it's combined with traditional classroom learning.**
>
>This can be seen in **how many successful online courses now include live video calls, group projects, and even occasional in-person meetings. Students can watch lectures at home but still meet with classmates for discussions.** A clear example of this is **that during COVID-19, the most effective schools didn't just move everything online - they found creative ways to mix online tools with real human interaction.**

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend could lead to **a future where education becomes more flexible and accessible to people everywhere, but we still keep the valuable parts of campus life that help students grow as complete human beings.**
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that **online education has made learning much more convenient and affordable for many people who couldn't attend traditional colleges before.** However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **the importance of human connections in learning** and **the success of combining online and offline methods**, I maintain my position that **the future of education lies in smart combination of both approaches rather than one completely replacing the other.**
>
>Therefore, the path forward is not to simply accept or reject **online education**, but to **use technology to make learning better while keeping the social and personal parts of traditional education that are so important for student development.** It is crucial that we focus on maximizing its benefits while actively managing its risks.

##### T15: The U.S. government's recent tariff threats have sparked widespread criticism. What is your comment on the recent tariff war? How does it impact the U.S. and China?

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **the recent tariff war between the U.S. and China** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in global trade.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **this trade war is a counterproductive, lose-lose strategy that negatively impacts not only both countries' economies but also the stability of the entire global supply chain.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **that tariffs ultimately hurt consumers in both countries by making everyday products more expensive.**
>
>To be specific, **when the U.S. puts tariffs on Chinese goods, American companies and consumers end up paying higher prices for everything from electronics to clothing. Similarly, when China responds with its own tariffs, Chinese consumers face higher costs for American products.** For instance, **a smartphone that used to cost $500 might now cost $600 because of these tariffs, which means ordinary families have less money to spend on other things they need.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **that this trade war disrupts the global supply chain that has been built over decades.**
>
>This can be seen in **how many companies rely on parts and materials from both countries to make their products. When tariffs make these materials more expensive, it affects businesses worldwide.** A clear example of this is **that a car company might use Chinese steel and American technology to build cars in Mexico. When tariffs increase costs, the company might have to raise prices or cut jobs, affecting workers in all three countries.**

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend could lead to **a world where countries become more isolated economically, which could slow down global economic growth and make it harder for developing countries to improve their living standards.**
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that **some people argue that tariffs can protect local jobs and industries from unfair competition, and both countries might want to reduce their dependence on each other for important goods.** However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **the higher costs for consumers** and **the disruption to global business**, I maintain my position that **the tariff war creates more problems than it solves and hurts the economic interests of both nations.**
>
>Therefore, the path forward is not to simply accept or reject **these trade policies**, but to **find better ways for both countries to cooperate and solve their disagreements through dialogue and negotiation rather than economic punishment.** It is crucial that we focus on maximizing the benefits of trade while actively managing any unfair practices through diplomatic means.

<h2 id="topic_20"></h2>

##### T20: What are the advantages and drawbacks of AI?

>[!note] 背景与观点（Context & Claim）
>
>The issue of **the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI)** has become a major point of discussion recently, reflecting a significant trend in our society and technology.
>
>This topic is complex, with various viewpoints and potential impacts. It presents both clear opportunities and significant challenges.
>
>After careful consideration, I believe that **AI is a powerful double-edged sword, and its development must be managed with great responsibility to maximize its benefits while actively mitigating its significant societal and ethical risks.**

>[!note] 分析与论证（Analysis & Arguments）
>
>The primary reason for my view is **that AI brings amazing benefits that can improve many aspects of our daily lives.**
>
>To be specific, **AI can help doctors diagnose diseases faster and more accurately, help students learn through personalized teaching programs, and make our work more efficient by handling routine tasks.** For instance, **AI translation tools like Google Translate have made it much easier for people from different countries to communicate, breaking down language barriers that existed for centuries.**
>
>Another significant factor that supports my position is **that AI also creates serious risks that we cannot ignore.**
>
>This can be seen in **how AI might replace many human jobs, leading to unemployment, and how it can be used to spread false information or invade people's privacy.** A clear example of this is **that deepfake technology can create fake videos of people saying things they never said, which could damage reputations or mislead the public during important events like elections.**

>[!note] 结果与反思（Results & Reflection）
>
>Looking at the broader implications, this trend could lead to **a future where AI either becomes a great tool that helps humanity solve major problems like climate change and poverty, or creates a society with massive inequality and loss of human control over important decisions.**
>
>Of course, we should also acknowledge that **many of the risks I mentioned are not guaranteed to happen, and with proper planning and regulation, we might be able to enjoy AI's benefits while avoiding most of its dangers.** However, this benefit seems less critical when compared to the problems I've mentioned.

>[!note] 结尾与展望（Ending & Exhoration）
>
>In conclusion, based on the analysis of **AI's incredible potential to improve our lives** and **its serious risks to employment and society**, I maintain my position that **AI development requires careful balance - we should embrace its benefits while being very careful about its risks.**
>
>Therefore, the path forward is not to simply accept or reject **AI technology**, but to **create strong rules and ethical guidelines for AI development, invest in retraining workers for new jobs, and ensure that AI serves humanity rather than replacing it.** It is crucial that we focus on maximizing its benefits while actively managing its risks.

#### T2: Please talk about an impressive movie you have watched. Why is it impressive?

> [!note] 引入主题（Introduction）
>
> When it comes to a movie that has left a lasting impression on me, the first one that comes to my mind is **the film 'Oppenheimer'**.
>
> For me, it's more than just a movie; it represents **a powerful and thought-provoking exploration of human ambition and moral responsibility**.

> [!note] 描述细节（Description & Details）
>
> To give you some context, **'Oppenheimer' is best known for its unique narrative structure, which jumps between different timelines to tell its story. This isn't just for style; it constantly forces the audience to connect the scientific achievements with their political consequences**.
>
> Specifically, I was most impressed by **the scene of the first atomic bomb test, known as the Trinity Test**. For example: **The film builds incredible tension by using complete silence for a long time. Then, we see the blinding flash of light first, long before we hear the deafening sound. This scientific accuracy makes the moment feel incredibly real and terrifying**.

> [!note] 解释情感（Explanation & Emotion）
>
> But the real reason why I find it so impressive is **its deep focus on the moral dilemma of its main character. It's not just a history lesson; it's a very human story**.
>
> There's something about **the internal conflict between his scientific ambition and his growing horror at the destructive power he created** that resonates with me deeply. It makes me feel **inspired by human genius, but also deeply cautious and thoughtful about its potential consequences**.

> [!note] 后续影响（Aftereffect & Application）
>
> And this has had a significant and lasting impact on my life.
>
> The key lesson I learned from this is that **great power, especially scientific and technological power, must come with an equally great sense of ethical responsibility**. Ever since watching this movie, I've tried to apply this idea to my own life by **thinking more critically about new technologies like Artificial Intelligence. I now try to consider not just what a new technology can do, but what it should do**. It has truly shaped my perspective on **the complex relationship between progress and humanity**.
