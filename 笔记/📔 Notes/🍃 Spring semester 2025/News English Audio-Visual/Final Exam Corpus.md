### T1: China has announced that it will allow couples to have up to <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(10, 137, 255)">three children</span>. To what extent will this policy <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">boost birth rates</span>? Provide reasons to support your answer

### Deep dive into the topic

- **Core question:** To what extent will this three-child policy increase the birth rate?

- **Task requirements:** Give the “extent” you think the effect is (e.g. a significant boost, <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">a limited impact</span>, a negligible effect), and provide sufficient reasons to support your point of view.

- **Key point:** The question "To what extent" requires you to not simply answer "yes" or "no", but to conduct a layered and <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">nuanced analysis</span>. A good answer will usually admit that it may have a certain effect, but will focus more on analyzing its limitations.

### Prepared manuscripts

#### Introduction: directly express my opinion: It has an effect, but it is <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">very limited</span>

China recently announced a major policy change, now allowing couples to have up to three children. This policy is designed to address serious population challenges, especially the country's aging population.

However, many experts agree that this policy by itself will likely have a very limited impact on raising the birth rate.

There are several strong social and economic reasons for this view.

#### Reason 1: Economic Pressures

The biggest and most direct obstacle is <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">the prohibitive cost of raising children in modern China</span>.  

For many urban families, the costs of housing, healthcare, and especially education are already a heavy burden

The competition in education is intense, and parents spend a lot on extra classes for even one child.

Therefore, having a third child is simply not a real choice for most couples.

#### Reason 2: Shifting Social Norms

Another key factor is the big change in <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">how people think about life and family</span>. 

Unlike their parents' generation, many young people today value their careers, personal freedom, and a good quality of life more. 

The traditional idea of having a big family is no longer popular. Also, the negative effect on a mother's career, sometimes called the 'motherhood penalty', is a major concern. 

Without better support from society, like affordable childcare, many women are unwilling to have more children.

#### Concession

Of course, the policy will have some effect. 

It will allow the small number of families who already wanted a third child to have one. This may cause a small, temporary increase in births. 

However, we should not expect too much. The weak response to the earlier two-child policy is a clear example from the past. It suggests these small increases don't change the long-term trend.

#### Conclusion

So, in conclusion, changing the rule is a necessary first step, but it is <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">not enough on its own</span>. 

For the policy to truly work, its success depends on a full package of real, helpful supporting policies. This includes things like financial help, better healthcare, and creating a work environment that is (more) friendly to mothers. 

Without solving these basic problems, the three-child policy will likely be more symbolic than effective (-- more of a headline than a real solution).

### T2: Talk about <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(10, 137, 255)">an impressive movie</span> you have watched. Explain why you think the movie is impressive. Give specific details and examples to explain your answer

- **Core Task**: Introduce a movie that impressed you and explain why with specific details and examples.

- **Key Point**: "Impressive" is a subjective word, you need to <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">make it objective and convincing</span>. You can't just say "it was fun" or "the actors were good", you must analyze the artistic, technical or ideological aspects of the movie in depth.

- **Course Background Requirements**: Your answer should sound like <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(255, 177, 10)">a short movie review</span> or cultural commentary, not a simple retelling of the plot.

#### Introduction

An impressive movie I've watched recently that left a lasting mark on me is Christopher Nolan's **'Oppenheimer'**. 

While on the surface it's a biographical film about the father of the atomic bomb, I found it truly impressive because it transcends the genre. It functions as **a monumental and chilling exploration of human genius, ambition, and the profound moral consequences of creation.**

#### Body 1: Innovative Narrative Structure

"**What first struck me as impressive was its brilliant narrative structure.** Nolan uses two intertwined timelines: one in color, representing Oppenheimer's subjective experience, and one in black-and-white, depicting a later, more objective political hearing. This isn't just a stylistic choice; it's a powerful storytelling device. The constant cutting between the two perspectives creates a sense of tension and inevitability. It masterfully shows how a scientist's personal ambition and moments of triumph are inextricably linked to the cold, political fallout that followed. It forces the audience to constantly re-evaluate what they are seeing."

**(Body 2: Profound Character Study)** "**Secondly, the film's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer is deeply compelling.** The movie avoids the simple trap of painting him as either a hero or a villain. Instead, it presents a man of immense contradictions: a brilliant physicist who was also profoundly naive, a leader who was haunted by his creation. **A specific example is the scene after the successful Trinity Test.** We see his public speech, where he almost revels in the success, but the sound cuts out and we see his internal horror—a vision of a charred body and the silent screams of his audience. This moment perfectly captures his internal conflict and makes him a tragic, deeply human figure, not just a historical footnote."

**(Body 3: Powerful Audiovisual Storytelling)** "**Finally, the movie's technical execution is breathtaking, particularly in its use of sound and visuals.** The Trinity Test sequence is a masterclass in building suspense. For what feels like an eternity, there is almost complete silence, only the sound of breathing and mechanical clicks. This absence of sound creates an almost unbearable tension. And when the detonation finally happens, we see the blinding flash of light first, in total silence. The soundwave, the deafening roar, arrives seconds later. This decision to portray the physics accurately—light traveling faster than sound—makes the moment not just a spectacle, but a terrifying and awe-inspiring experience. It’s pure cinematic genius that puts you right in the heart of that world-changing event."

**(Conclusion)** "**In conclusion, 'Oppenheimer' is much more than just a well-made historical drama.** It's an impressive piece of cinema because of its sophisticated narrative, its complex character study, and its masterful technical craft. It doesn't just tell you a story; it makes you feel the weight of it. Most importantly, it serves as a powerful cautionary tale, urging us to consider the ethical responsibilities that must accompany scientific advancement—a question that is more relevant than ever in our age of AI and other transformative technologies."
