##### The Bloch Theorem

For a periodic potential, i.e.

$$V(\boldsymbol{r} + \boldsymbol{R}_n) = V(\boldsymbol{r})$$

where $\boldsymbol{R}_n$ takes all lattice vectors of the Bravais lattice, the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for a single electron is

$$\hat{H} \psi(\boldsymbol{r}) = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V(\boldsymbol{r}) \right] \psi(\boldsymbol{r}) = \varepsilon \psi(\boldsymbol{r}) \tag{4.1}$$

The eigenfunctions of $\hat{H}$ are plane wave functions modulated by periodic functions of the Bravais lattice, i.e.

$$\psi_{\boldsymbol{k}}(\boldsymbol{r}) = e^{i\boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{r}} u_{\boldsymbol{k}}(\boldsymbol{r}) \tag{4.2}$$

and

$$u_{\boldsymbol{k}}(\boldsymbol{r} + \boldsymbol{R}_n) = u_{\boldsymbol{k}}(\boldsymbol{r}) \tag{4.3}$$

It is easy to derive from the above that Bloch's theorem can also be expressed as for each eigenvalue problem of the above SchrÃ¶dinger equation, there exists a wave vector $\boldsymbol{k}$, such that

$$\psi(\boldsymbol{r} + \boldsymbol{R}_n) = e^{i\boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{R}_n} \psi(\boldsymbol{r}) \tag{4.4}$$

It holds for all lattice vectors $R_n$ of the Bravais lattice. $\psi_{\boldsymbol{k}}(\boldsymbol{r})$ is called the Bloch function.

Bloch's theorem is derived from the translational symmetry of the crystal, and any wave in a periodic structure should have the form of a Bloch function.

##### Hasaya

The value of the wave vector $\boldsymbol{k}$ is determined by the periodic boundary conditions (Bloch-Fermi boundary conditions), i.e.

$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\psi(\boldsymbol{r} + N_1 \boldsymbol{a}_1) = \psi(\boldsymbol{r}) \\
\psi(\boldsymbol{r} + N_2 \boldsymbol{a}_2) = \psi(\boldsymbol{r}) \\
\psi(\boldsymbol{r} + N_3 \boldsymbol{a}_3) = \psi(\boldsymbol{r})
\end{array}
\right. \tag{4.5}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{a}_i (i = 1, 2, 3)$ are the three lattice vectors of the Bravais lattice, $N = N_1 N_2 N_3$ is the total number of unit cells in the crystal, and $N_i$ is an integer of order $N^{1/3}$.

##### Three Basic Approximations

1. **Adiabatic approximation**

Due to the huge mass difference between electrons and atomic nuclei, the velocity of electrons is much greater than that of atomic nuclei, allowing the treatment of electrons and nuclei as two separate systems without energy exchange. When considering the motion of electrons, the nuclei can be considered stationary.

2. **Single electron approximation**

The influence of the solid's ions and the remaining electrons can be replaced by an average field, simplifying the wave equation problem of many electrons to that of a single electron.

3. **Periodic field approximation**

Regardless of the interaction between a single electron and the ions in the crystal or the interaction among the remaining electrons, it is assumed that the total potential field experienced by a single electron in the crystal is a periodic field.

In short, by using the adiabatic approximation, the problem of many particles composed of a large number of atomic nuclei (ions) and electrons is transformed into a problem of many electrons. Using the single electron approximation, it is further transformed into a problem of a single electron. Then, using the periodic field (average field) approximation, the motion of a single electron in the crystal is considered as the motion of the electron in the "field formed by the average charge distribution of positive ions and other electrons."

##### Near-free electron approximation for electron motion in a one-dimensional periodic field

The so-called near-free electron approximation is: *assuming that the periodic field is small, the average value $\bar{V}$ of the potential can be used to replace $V(x)$, and the periodic potential $[V(x) - \bar{V}]$ is treated as a perturbation.* 

The wave equation for the zeroth-order approximation is

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}x^2} \psi^0 + \bar{V} \psi^0 = E^0 \psi^0 \tag{4.7}
$$

The solution for the free particle in the constant field $\bar{V}$ is:

$$
\psi_k^0(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L}} e^{ikx}, \quad E_k^0 = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} + \bar{V} \tag{4.8}
$$

where the lattice length $L = Na$, $N$ is the number of unit cells, $a$ is the lattice constant (interatomic distance). The value of $k$ is determined by the periodic boundary conditions

$$
k = \frac{l}{Na} (2\pi) \quad (l \in \mathbb{Z}) \tag{4.9}
$$

The wave function satisfies the normalization condition. It is because the zeroth-order approximate solution corresponds to free electrons that this approximation is called the nearly-free electron approximation.

Under general perturbation theory (without degeneracy), the first and second-order corrections to the eigenvalues are given by:

$$
E_k^{(1)} = \langle k | \Delta V | k \rangle = 0
$$

$$
E_k^{(2)} = \sum_{k'} \frac{|\langle k' | \Delta V | k \rangle|^2}{E_k^0 - E_{k'}^0}
$$

The first-order correction to the wave function is:

$$
\psi_k^{(1)} = \sum_{k'} \frac{\langle k' | \Delta V | k \rangle}{E_k^0 - E_{k'}^0} \psi_{k'}^0
$$

It can be proven that:

$$
\langle k' | \Delta V | k \rangle = \langle k' | V(x) | k \rangle =
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle \frac{1}{a} \int_0^a e^{-i 2\pi \frac{n}{a} \xi} V(\xi) d\xi = V_n, & k' = k + \frac{n}{a} 2\pi \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

For states $k$ close to $-\frac{n\pi}{a}$, a degenerate perturbation treatment should be applied.

$$
k = -\frac{n\pi}{a}(1 - \Delta), \, \Delta << 1
$$

Under the perturbation of a periodic field, the main effect is the mixing with states that have energies close to it:
$$
k = \frac{n\pi}{a}(1 + \Delta), \, \Delta << 1
$$

Using an approximate treatment method, all other mixed states are ignored, and the wave function is written as:

$$
\psi = a\psi_k^0 + b\psi_{k'}^0
$$

where $\psi_k^0$ and $\psi_{k'}^0$ satisfy equation (4.7), with corresponding eigenvalues $E_k^0$ and $E_{k'}^0$. From equation (4.7) and the wave equation:

$$
\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x) - E\right] \psi(x) = 0
$$

the eigenvalues can be solved as:

$$
E_\pm = \frac{1}{2} \left\{(E_k^0 + E_{k'}^0) \pm \left[(E_k^0 - E_{k'}^0)^2 + 4|V_n|^2\right]^{1/2}\right\}
$$

Now, two cases are discussed:

(1) $|E_k^0 - E_{k'}^0| >> |V_n|$, i.e., state $k$ is far from $-\frac{n\pi}{a}$.

At this point, there is still a significant difference in energy between the $k$ and $k'$ states. Expanding equation (4.10) with respect to $|V_n|/(E_k^0 - E_{k'}^0)$ and taking the first-order approximation yields:

$$
E_\pm =
\begin{cases}
E_{k'}^0 + \frac{|V_n|^2}{E_{k'}^0 - E_k^0} \\
E_k^0 - \frac{|V_n|^2}{E_{k'}^0 - E_k^0}
\end{cases}
$$

Here, it is assumed that $\Delta > 0$ (i.e., $E_{k'}^0 > E_k^0$). From the above equation, it can be seen that the mutual influence results in an increase in the energy of the originally higher-energy $k'$ state and a decrease in the energy of the originally lower-energy $k$ state. This is a general result in quantum mechanics, known as the "repulsion effect" between energy levels.

(2) $|E_k^0 - E_{k'}^0| << |V_n|$, i.e., $k$ is very close to $-\frac{n\pi}{a}$.

Expanding equation (4.10) with respect to $(E_{k'}^0 - E_k^0)/|V_n|$ to the first order and using the relationship between $k$ and $\Delta$ gives:

$$
E_\pm =
\begin{cases}
\bar{V} + T_n + |V_n| + \Delta^2 T_n \left(\frac{2T_n}{|V_n|} + 1\right) \\
\bar{V} + T_n - |V_n| - \Delta^2 T_n \left(\frac{2T_n}{|V_n|} - 1\right)
\end{cases}
$$

where $T_n$ represents the kinetic energy when $k = \frac{n\pi}{a}$:
$$
T_n = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left(\frac{n\pi}{a}\right)^2
$$

When $\Delta \to 0$, $E_\pm$ approaches $\bar{V} + T_n \pm |V_n|$ in a parabolic manner.

##### Energy band and Energy gap

Due to the influence of the periodic potential field, the $E(k)$ function will be discontinuous at $k = \frac{\pi}{a}n$, with an energy jump of $2|V_n|$. According to equation (4.9), for each $l$, there is one quantum state, and its energy can be found from the $E(k)$ graph. By plotting all the energy levels of the quantum states, when $N$ is very large, the values of $k$ become extremely dense, and the corresponding energy levels are also very dense. Therefore, they are sometimes referred to as quasi-continuous.

The quasi-continuous energy levels split into a series of bands $1, 2, 3, \dots$, which correspond to the first Brillouin zone, second Brillouin zone, third Brillouin zone, etc. These bands are called energy bands. The energy levels belonging to one Brillouin zone form an energy band, and different Brillouin zones correspond to different energy bands. Within an energy band, the energy levels are quasi-continuous.

The intervals between the bands are called energy gaps, and no energy levels exist within the gaps. The widths of the various gaps directly correspond to the discontinuities in the $E(k)$ curve at $k = \frac{\pi}{a}n$, i.e., $2|V_1|, 2|V_2|, 2|V_3|, \dots$.

The formation of energy bands by the energy levels of electrons moving in a periodic field is one of the most fundamental results of band theory. Each energy band corresponds to the range of $k$ values within a Brillouin zone, such as $2\pi/a$ in the one-dimensional case. Each energy band contains $k$ values within this range.



##### Energy State Density

Corresponding to the density of lattice vibration modes, the concept of density of states is introduced.
Considering the spin, the general expression for the density of states is

$$
N_n(E) = \frac{V}{4\pi^3} \int \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{|\nabla_{\boldsymbol{k}} E_n(\boldsymbol{k})|} \tag{4.28}
$$

The density of states for one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional free electron gases are respectively

**One-dimensional:** 

$$N(E) = \frac{L}{\pi} \left( \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \right)^{1/2} E^{-1/2} \quad (\text{where $L$ is the length of the lattice})$$

**Two-dimensional:** 

$$N(E) = \frac{S}{\pi \hbar^2} m \quad (\text{where $S$ is the area of the lattice})$$

**Three-dimensional:** 

$$N(E) = \frac{2V}{(2\pi)^2} \left( \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \right)^{3/2} E^{1/2} \quad (\text{where $V$ is the volume of the lattice})$$

>[!warning] Van Hove Singularity
> Because the energy band function $E_n(\boldsymbol{k})$ is a periodic function in reciprocal space, there are always some $\boldsymbol{k}$ values where $|\nabla_{\boldsymbol{k}}E| = 0$ in each unit cell, leading to a divergence in the integral of the density of states formula. For the three-dimensional case, it is still integrable, giving a finite $N_n(E)$, but the slope $\frac{\mathrm{d}N_n(E)}{\mathrm{d}E}$ diverges, and this divergence of $N_n(E)$ is called the Van Hove singularity.
>
> Van Hove singularity (Singularity) arises from **the unique symmetry of crystal materials**, and similar issues are encountered in the density of lattice vibration modes (lattice vibration mode density).

##### Fermi Surface and Free Electron Sphere Radius

If there are $N$ electrons in a solid, and the electrons are considered free electrons, $N$ electrons fill a sphere of radius $k_F$ in $k$-space, then we have

$$k_F = 2\pi \left( \frac{3}{8\pi} \right)^{1/3} n^{1/3} \tag{4.29}$$

where $n = \frac{N}{V}$ is **the electron number density**.

Generally, this sphere is called the Fermi sphere, $k_F$ is the Fermi radius, the surface of the sphere is the Fermi surface. The Fermi surface is the boundary between the occupied and unoccupied electron regions in $k$-space. The energy value of the Fermi surface is the Fermi energy $E_F$, the momentum $\boldsymbol{p}_F = \hbar \boldsymbol{k}_F$ is the Fermi momentum, and $\boldsymbol{v}_F = \boldsymbol{p}_F/m$ is the Fermi velocity.

>[!warning] Free Electron Sphere Radius

#### Knowledge Summary

##### Fermi Distribution Function

For the equilibrium state of a system, the basic principle of Fermi-Dirac statistics is summarized as the so-called Fermi distribution function:

$$
f(E) = \frac{1}{e^{(E - E_\mathrm{F})/k_\mathrm{B}T} + 1} \tag{6.1}
$$

where $E_\mathrm{F}$ is the Fermi energy level, which can be determined by the following equation ($N$ is the total number of electrons in the system):

$$
\sum_i f(E_i) = N
$$

Using the density of states function $N(E)$, the above equation can be written as:

$$
N = \int_0^\infty f(E) N(E) \, \mathrm{d}E \tag{6.2}
$$

Introducing the function $Q(E)$ (representing the total number of quantum states below energy $E$):

$$
Q(E) = \int_0^E N(E) \, \mathrm{d}E
$$

By performing integration by parts and rewriting the limits of integration, expanding $Q(E)$ near the Fermi energy level to the second order, we obtain:

$$
N = Q(E_\mathrm{F}) + \frac{\pi^2}{6} Q''(E_\mathrm{F}) (k_\mathrm{B}T)^2 \tag{6.3}
$$
