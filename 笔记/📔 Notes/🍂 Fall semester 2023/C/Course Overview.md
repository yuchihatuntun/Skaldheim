### Intro

#### Self-study phase

During the summer break before school started, I dabbled in some self-study—following [Ken-Yi Lee](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1WJ411H7v2/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click)'s tutorials and setting up the [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) IDE—but never went through any proper textbooks systematically.

#### Course Information

### Recommended online class resources

- [Ken-Yi Lee](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1WJ411H7v2/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click): My C programming mentor—who also introduced me to coding—had the no-nonsense teaching style typical of Taiwanese instructors. The course followed a standard textbook approach: basic syntax → pointers. The explanations were generally clear enough to grasp in one pass (the language wasn’t so obscure as to require constant DeepSeek-level lookups). The syntax portion was particularly well-explained (even watchable at 2x speed without issues), but the pointers section felt a bit rushed, and data structures were entirely omitted (likely due to time constraints in recording the online course—a slight disappointment).

### Recommended Textbook

- [C Primer Plus](https://vip.123pan.cn/1823290578/13311658): The designated textbook for school. This book is very good as an entry-level textbook. It also has a relatively high score on Zhihu. The exercise solutions are optional to buy. However, it is recommended not to buy them (as they are easy to gather dust).
