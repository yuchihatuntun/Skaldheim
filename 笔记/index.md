Welcome to this open-source knowledge base, crafted by [Ruilin Xu](https://github.com/yuchihatuntun), a dedicated 2023 undergraduate from the School of Microelectronics Science and Technology at Sun Yat-sen University.
# Positioning and objectives of the knowledge base

This open-source knowledge base was created by students from the Class of 2023 at the School of Microelectronics Science and Technology. As such, it naturally leans toward providing exam preparation materials tailored to the microelectronics and related fields. However, we warmly welcome students from other disciplines to contribute and benefit from this platform.
## Problems to be solved by this website

The primary goal of this knowledge base is to address the challenges faced by sophomore and junior students in preparing for specialized courses. Many students struggle with the scarcity of high-quality, reliable study materials, which are often scattered and inconsistent. Our platform aims to centralize and curate these resources, offering a comprehensive and accessible repository of course notes, past exam papers, key concept summaries, and more.

By fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing, we hope to create a supportive community where students can find the tools they need to excel in their studies. Whether you're a microelectronics major or from another field, your contributions and participation are invaluable in making this resource even more robust and inclusive.
