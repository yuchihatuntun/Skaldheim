### Course At-a-Glance

- **Lecturer :** Gengzhen Qi

- **Self-assessment :** **S.H.I.T.** 💩 (There's something off about this teacher's mindset and priorities, which seems to be an occupational hazard for those in the field of analog electronics.)

### Grade Composition

>The graduate teaching assistants are utterly subhuman. If you dare to make a single calculation error in your homework, tough luck—you get zero marks for the entire assignment.

> You'd better at least glance at this exam paper before the final—memorize the answers if nothing else. I swear, knowing this alone will be enough to get you a passing grade. I'd bet this exact exam will carry over for at least 2 or 3 more batches of MST students.
