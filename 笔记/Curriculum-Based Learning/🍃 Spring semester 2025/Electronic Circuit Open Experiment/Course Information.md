### Course At-a-Glance

- **Lecturer :**  Zhong Guan & Ming Xiao & Qingqing Ke

- **Self-assessment :** To be fair, Professor Ke might genuinely want to teach us something. Her expertise is in sensors, hence the need for Arduino to test them. But on the other hand, Professor Guan —no, the Header Guan —only care about his own business. Having TAs just read verbatim from the PowerPoints sinks the MST course experience to a historic low. <span style="background:#d2cbff">Anyway, it's still a shitty course.</span>

### Grade Composition

| Grade Type             | Weighting | Specific Description                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Usual Performance**​ | 40%       | Attendance and regular lab sessions (to be checked and approved by teaching assistants)      |
| **Final Exam**​        | 60%       | A course project that requires building a physical prototype and submitting the source code. |

### Holy artifact

- **The course project**：[[Course Design Specification Document]]

>I totally get it. You're drowning in finals — surrounded by Analog ICs, Solid-State Physics, Semiconductor Physics, Electromagnetic Fields, and Marxist Philosophy. Who has any energy left for this nonsense course project? Just use this one. This project was ranked #1 (1/160) in the 23rd cohort of MST for that course. It comes with detailed documentation, full code, and a parts list (total cost under 10 RMB).
