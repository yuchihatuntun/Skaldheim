### Course At-a-Glance

- **Lecturer :** Qingming Chen

- **Self-assessment :** This professor is practically a walking angel. If you get the chance, you should definitely reach out to him and try to join his research group. I highly, highly recommend it!

### Holy artifact

- **Note**：

- **Cheatsheet**：

>You might be wondering why a closed-book exam comes with a cheat sheet. Well, this one was made by the professor himself! The exam tests exactly these formulas. Memorize them, and getting a 90%+ is practically in the bag.
