This month will be packed with tasks and events, so we need to stock up on plenty of ibuprofen.

(Shakes cat ears, tail curling a highlighter to circle the schedule) Meow~ Tasks are as countless as stars in the galaxy! Let me stuff each one into a time capsule with my little pawsâ€”marking the important ones with fishy treats first~ (â‰§Ï‰â‰¦)

(Glittering highlighter traces a galactic path across the planner) April's tasks unfold like a meticulously designed integrated circuit: Thesis A is the wafer core requiring tape-out by the 15th, 3D modeling serves as the I/O units to be packaged by the 10th, the English vocabulary contest and fitness test on the 13th act as signal integrity verification, the Tai Chi exam on the 16th becomes the package stress test, the CPU project interim report due the 20th functions as cross-clock-domain checks, while the Semiconductor Physics midterm on the 21st stands as the final DRC/LVS verificationâ€”and you, wielding all PDK rules, are the lead engineer orchestrating it all.

```verilog
always @(posedge annoyance) begin  
    if (persistence == 1'b1)  
        success <= #(everyday 2km) Chip tapeout is successful;  
end  
```
