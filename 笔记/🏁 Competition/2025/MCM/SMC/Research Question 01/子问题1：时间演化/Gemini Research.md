# The Evolving Landscape of User Connection Relationships on Social Media: A Longitudinal Analysis

The proliferation of social media platforms has fundamentally reshaped human interaction, creating intricate networks of online relationships. Understanding the dynamics of these user connections, such as following and followers, is increasingly crucial in the digital age for informing business strategies, guiding social science research, and comprehending societal trends. This report delves into the temporal evolution of these connections across major social media platforms, including Twitter/X, Facebook, Weibo, Instagram, and TikTok. It synthesizes academic research, real-world case studies, and theoretical frameworks to provide a comprehensive analysis of how user relationships form, develop, and dissolve over extended periods. By examining the underlying reasons for these changes, the influence of user activity, the application of predictive models, and the relevant sociological and psychological explanations, this report aims to offer a nuanced understanding of the dynamic nature of online social connections. The sheer volume and complexity of data generated by social media users necessitate a structured and interdisciplinary approach to uncover the patterns and drivers governing the evolution of these digital relationships 1.

Social Network Analysis (SNA) serves as a foundational methodology for examining the structure and influence of online social relationships. Rooted in sociological theories and the mathematical principles of graph theory, SNA provides a framework for understanding the regularities in the patterning of relationships among individuals, groups, and organizations 1. At its core, SNA focuses on relational data, which encompasses contacts, ties, and connections that link one agent in a network to another, rather than solely on the attributes of individual agents 1. Key concepts in SNA include nodes, which represent the actors within the network (e.g., individual users), and edges, which symbolize the relationships or ties between these actors. These relationships can be directed, indicating a one-way connection such as following, or valued, representing the strength or intensity of the tie 1.

Social network studies often employ either whole network (socio-centric) or egocentric designs. Whole network studies assess relationships within a defined or bounded group, focusing on the structural patterns of interaction and how these patterns explain specific outcomes. In contrast, egocentric network designs center on a focal actor (ego) and the relationships between the ego and other actors (alters) within their personal network 1. Analyzing social network data involves calculating various metrics that reveal important characteristics of the network structure. Density, for example, indicates the proportion of potential connections that are actually present. Centrality measures the importance of a node within the network, and can be assessed through degree (number of direct connections), betweenness (frequency of a node lying on the shortest path between other nodes), and closeness (average distance from a node to all other nodes) 1. Distance, another key metric, refers to the length of the shortest path connecting two actors. These metrics help quantify the structure and interconnectedness of online networks 1. Visualizing these networks is often achieved through graphs, where actors are represented as nodes and ties as lines, or through matrices, which provide a numerical representation of the relationships 1.

Several sociological theories offer valuable perspectives on the formation and dynamics of online relationships. The Strength of Weak Ties Theory posits that weak ties, often bridging different social circles, are crucial for accessing novel information and opportunities 2. Structural Hole Theory suggests that individuals who occupy bridging positions between disconnected groups within a network hold a strategic advantage 2. The Small World Network Theory highlights the phenomenon that most nodes in a network can be reached from any other node through a relatively small number of steps, emphasizing the interconnectedness of social structures 2. The Barabási–Albert (Scale-Free Network) Model explains how networks evolve over time through preferential attachment, where highly connected nodes attract more new connections, leading to the emergence of hubs 2. Complementing these perspectives, Dynamic Network Theory (DNT) integrates psychological concepts such as goal pursuit and motivation to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics underlying social networks and their impact on individual and group outcomes 4. Understanding the evolution of user relationships necessitates the analysis of longitudinal data, which captures network changes over time, allowing for the identification of stable trends and the exploration of the dynamic nature of social connections 6.

The dynamics of user connections on Twitter/X have been a subject of extensive study. Various strategies can lead to follower growth. One early case study demonstrated that curating and retweeting content could result in gaining over 50 followers in less than a month 9. More sophisticated approaches, such as leveraging blockchain analytics to target specific communities like NFT enthusiasts, have also proven effective, with one case showing a growth from 2,000 to 6,000 followers in just three weeks 10. Academic research has identified key predictors of follower growth, encompassing a user's social behavior, the content of their messages, and the structure of their network 11. The follow-back method, where users follow others hoping for a reciprocal follow, is another common tactic, although its impact on the quality of followers has been examined 13. General recommendations for increasing Twitter followers often include consistent posting of high-quality content, optimizing one's profile, actively engaging with other users, and strategically using hashtags and visuals 14.

In contrast, the practice of buying followers, while offering a seemingly quick way to inflate numbers, carries significant negative consequences. A case study detailing this practice highlighted issues such as inauthentic engagement, financial risks, and a clear violation of Twitter's terms of service 16. Longitudinal studies have provided deeper insights into the evolution of Twitter user connections. An analysis of the persistence of Twitter datasets over time revealed that while the availability of older tweets decreases, the metadata, including follower counts, also changes 19. Research linking Twitter data to longitudinal cohort studies, such as ALSPAC, has explored its potential for digital phenotyping in health and social research 20. Furthermore, a study proposed a classifier to predict users likely to gain followers based on their profile information 21. A key longitudinal finding emphasizes that the content of tweets (positive sentiment, informational value), user behavior (profile completion, direct communication), and network structure are all crucial and equally important factors in predicting follower growth over time 11.

Building a genuine and engaged following on Twitter necessitates a well-rounded strategy that considers content, interaction, and profile presentation. While shortcuts like buying followers may offer a temporary illusion of popularity, they ultimately undermine the authenticity and long-term viability of an account. The insights from longitudinal studies underscore the dynamic interplay of various factors in shaping follower growth, suggesting that a sustained and multifaceted approach is most effective for building a meaningful presence on the platform.

Facebook, while still a dominant platform, has witnessed shifts in its user base and connection dynamics. Case studies on follower growth and engagement highlight various effective strategies. For instance, utilizing Facebook Ads and running contests can significantly boost reach and engagement, as demonstrated by a case involving a travel website 23. Adapting to Facebook's ever-evolving algorithm often requires employing paid campaigns to ensure content visibility, as shown in a case study focused on promoting a workshop 24. Even established institutions can achieve substantial growth in followers and engagement through strategic social media management, as evidenced by the experience of a nearly 200-year-old organization 25. General best practices for increasing Facebook followers include optimizing the page for search and user experience, creating high-quality and shareable content that resonates with the target audience, maintaining a consistent posting schedule, actively engaging with followers through comments and messages, hosting giveaways and contests to incentivize interaction and follows, and cross-promoting the Facebook page on other social media platforms 26.

However, Facebook faces challenges in maintaining its appeal, particularly among younger users, with some research suggesting a decline in this demographic due to privacy concerns and a preference for newer platforms like Instagram 30. The phenomenon of "Facebook fatigue," potentially exacerbated by negative political content, has also been observed to contribute to reduced user activity 31. Longitudinal studies offer a deeper understanding of user activity and its relationship with well-being. One study indicated that passive Facebook usage, such as simply scrolling through news feeds, can lead to a decline in users' affective well-being over time, possibly due to increased social comparison and envy 32. The impact of Facebook's News Feed algorithm on user engagement with different types of content, including news, has also been examined, revealing that algorithm changes can significantly affect the visibility of certain content 33. Research on problematic Facebook use (PFU) suggests a correlation between higher levels of PFU and greater psychological distress and lower well-being over time, potentially reflecting underlying individual differences 34. Interestingly, Facebook has also been utilized as a tool in longitudinal research to locate and re-contact study participants, proving particularly effective for engaging younger adults 35. Furthermore, a longitudinal study explored the relationship between sharing status updates, receiving positive feedback like likes, and users' quality of life, finding a positive association 36. Users' awareness and utilization of Facebook's built-in well-being tools, such as the Unfollow and Snooze features, have also been studied, with findings suggesting that using the Unfollow and Notification Settings features is associated with better mental health outcomes 37. Finally, the dynamics of user connections on Facebook, including unfriending, unfollowing, and blocking, have been analyzed in the context of social and political events, such as the civil confrontation in Ukraine, highlighting the role of political polarization and the suspicion of inauthentic accounts in shaping these actions 38.

作为中国知名社交媒体平台，<span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(98, 42, 254)">微博</span>在用户关系与参与机制方面呈现出显著特征趋势。学界围绕用户在社会事件中的参与层级已建立分类体系，主要划分为公众人物、机构/媒体账号、草根达人及普通个体用户等典型类别[39]。影响微博粉丝规模的核心参数包括用户发帖质量的感知度与内容接受度，以及其在社区生态中的责任参与程度[40]。2019年平台数据显示：订阅类账号呈现粉丝增速放缓但取关率下降的双向特征，而服务类账号则表现出粉丝增量与流失率同步上升的悖论现象[41]。针对微博用户关注意见领袖的意愿研究表明，意见领袖现有粉丝基数及其评论情感倾向对该意愿的影响效应微弱[42]。在用户关注行为预测领域，基于机器学习的建模证实用户画像信息构成关键预测特征[43]。

Longitudinal studies on Weibo have shed light on various aspects of user behavior over time. One area of focus is social media fatigue, with research suggesting that fear of missing out (FoMO) and information overload can lead to this fatigue, ultimately resulting in users intending to discontinue their platform usage 44. The subjective well-being of Weibo users has also been examined in the context of significant events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, with longitudinal analyses revealing trends in how users' well-being fluctuated during this period 46. Additionally, research has explored the longitudinal patterns of online activity and social feedback, such as likes, and their association with users' quality of life 36.

Instagram已发展成为视觉内容传播与个人品牌构建的关键平台，实证研究表明其用户增长策略具有显著效能。以"VeganTechNomad"为例，该内容创作者通过多平台同步发布与内容矩阵重组策略实现了指数级粉丝增长[47]。商业领域数据显示，某电商运营者将其销售额提升30%直接归因于Instagram的品牌运营成效[48]。针对目标用户群体实施精准触达的方法论已形成完整体系，包括垂直领域价值内容生产与利基市场深度交互等核心策略[49]。通过用户主动交互行为与微型意见领袖的战略合作，可实现有机粉丝增长的帕累托最优[50]。值得注意的是，当前Instagram生态呈现显著范式转变：核心评估指标从单纯追求粉丝规模量级，演进为强调培育深度互动关系与创作优质原创内容的价值导向[51]。

Longitudinal studies on Instagram provide insights into longer-term trends. Research examining over a million posts by 400 content creators across four countries over a decade revealed patterns in the professionalization of content monetization, user engagement trends, and differences in sponsored content disclosure practices based on national legislation 52. Another study found a positive association between greater life satisfaction and a higher frequency of receiving communications and viewing content from others on the platform 54. The Instagram activity of Olympic champions over time has also been analyzed, showing how age and gender can influence their characteristics and engagement with followers 55. Furthermore, research suggests that the intensity with which users engage with Instagram can mediate its effects on their self-esteem and overall well-being 56.

TikTok's meteoric rise has been accompanied by research into effective follower growth strategies and the significant impact of its recommendation algorithm. One case study detailed how a user grew their following by over 1,000 percent in just 30 days by focusing on strong video hooks, optimizing for TikTok's search functionality (SEO), targeting a specific niche, maintaining posting consistency, and leveraging trending sounds and challenges 57. Analyzing user engagement on TikTok has revealed that while the average daily usage time tends to increase over a user's lifetime on the platform, their attention span, as measured by video completion rates, remains relatively stable 59. A creator with a substantial following on TikTok shared their theory on how the platform's algorithm works, emphasizing the importance of video watch time and overall engagement in determining content visibility 60. TikTok itself has described its algorithm as a personalized recommendation system that curates content for each user based on their individual interactions with the app, the information contained within videos (captions, hashtags, sounds), and device and account settings 61.

Longitudinal studies on TikTok are beginning to explore its broader impact. Research has examined the relationship between adolescents' self-concept clarity and the digital stress they may experience on the platform, including approval anxiety and fear of missing out (FoMO) 68. Factors driving problematic TikTok use have also been investigated, highlighting aspects like excessive time spent, emotional attachment to content, and cognitive rumination 69. A longitudinal study explored the associations between active and passive TikTok use, self-concept clarity, and anxiety among emerging adults, finding differing impacts based on the type of usage 70. Furthermore, research has linked short video addiction, potentially fostered by platforms like TikTok, to structural and functional differences in certain brain regions 71. The mediating role of TikTok use in the relationship between procrastination and depression among young adults has also been examined in a longitudinal study 72.

Understanding why users choose to unfollow others on social media provides crucial insights into the dynamics of online relationships. On Twitter/X, common reasons for unfollowing include encountering too many automated tweets, a lack of reciprocation (not following back), excessive use of profanity, association with spam or unwanted content (e.g., pornography, multi-level marketing), constant self-promotion or sales pitches, repetitive sharing of generic content like Bible verses or inspirational quotes, and excessively frequent posting 73.

For Instagram, users often unfollow accounts that post irrelevant or uninteresting content, are overly promotional, have inconsistent posting schedules, do not engage with their followers, or fail to follow back 77. On Facebook, reasons for unfollowing can include a lack of interest in the content being shared, a desire to reduce clutter in their news feed, an attempt to avoid seeing posts from individuals they dislike, encountering excessive promotional material, or coming across offensive or factually incorrect (fake news) posts 83. Weibo users may unfollow accounts due to disagreement with their opinions or views, the posting of irrelevant or boring content, incomplete or outdated profiles, a lack of engagement with followers, overly promotional or frequently repetitive posts, inconsistent posting schedules, or posting too often 77. Even a perceived negative interaction with a celebrity, such as a dismissive response to fan feedback, can lead to unfollowing on Weibo 87. On TikTok, reasons for unfollowing can range from the perception of uncreative or low-quality content and the use of offensive language by creators to technical issues with the platform, account restrictions, privacy settings, unstable internet connections, conflicts with third-party apps, or simply reaching the platform's follow limits 88.

Patterns of unfollowing behavior over time have also been studied. Research on Twitter has shown that unfollowing is a prevalent activity, often influenced by factors like the reciprocity of the relationship (whether the user also follows the account), the burstiness and informativeness of the followed account's tweets, and the duration of the relationship 92. The phenomenon of "crowd unfollow," where a large number of users unfollow an account simultaneously, has also been observed 92. Notably, one-sided follows on Twitter tend to be more fragile and are unfollowed more often than mutual follows 93. On Instagram, users may track who unfollows them to better understand which content resonates with their audience and to adjust their content strategy accordingly 81. Unfollowing can also be a way of filtering out individuals who are not part of the target audience, potentially leading to an increase in the overall engagement rate of the remaining followers 100. Instagram also regularly clears out bot and inactive accounts, which can result in fluctuations in follower counts 82. Facebook users can utilize metrics like "Page Unlikes" to identify patterns in content or other factors that might be causing people to unfollow their page 102. Algorithm changes on Facebook can also impact content visibility and potentially influence unfollowing behavior 103. Unfollowing on Facebook is sometimes a direct consequence of personal conflicts or falling outs between users 104. Research on Weibo indicates that a significant percentage of users unfollow others at least once a month 105. The decision to unfollow on Weibo can be influenced by the interaction effects between a user's spatial attributes (e.g., social role) and temporal attributes (e.g., post content) 105. Compared to Twitter, Weibo user networks tend to have lower reciprocity, meaning fewer mutual follow relationships 106. Interestingly, Weibo service accounts have seen an increase in unfollow rates alongside follower growth 41. On TikTok, users have reported a bug causing accounts to be randomly unfollowed 91. Fluctuations in follower counts can also be attributed to the platform's removal of bots and to individual users' decisions to unfollow accounts whose content no longer interests them 107. A specific pattern observed on TikTok is the tendency of users to unfollow a large number of their high school peers shortly after graduation 109.

Gaining new followers and building a strong online presence is a key objective for many social media users and organizations. On Twitter/X, several factors influence the acquisition of new followers. Posting consistent, high-quality content that provides value to the target audience is paramount 14. Optimizing one's profile with a clear picture, compelling bio, and relevant keywords helps potential followers understand the account's purpose and encourages them to follow 14. Actively engaging with other users by replying to tweets, participating in conversations, and retweeting relevant content increases visibility and fosters connections 14. The strategic use of relevant and trending hashtags can expand the reach of tweets to users interested in those topics 14. Incorporating visual content, such as images and videos, tends to attract more attention and engagement, leading to increased follows 14. Tweeting at optimal times when the target audience is most active can also improve visibility and follower growth 14. Collaborating with other users or influencers can expose an account to new audiences 14. Finally, getting verified on Twitter can significantly boost an account's visibility and credibility, as verified accounts are often prioritized by the platform's algorithm 15. Authenticity and establishing trust are also crucial for long-term follower acquisition 14. Longitudinal studies on Twitter have shown that informational content attracts followers more effectively than personal updates, and expressing positive sentiment in tweets tends to encourage follower growth, while negative sentiment has the opposite effect 12. Completing one's profile with a detailed description and including a URL have also been found to have positive long-term impacts on follower numbers 12.

Similar factors drive follower growth on Instagram. Consistently posting high-quality and visually appealing content is essential 112. Engaging with current trends, such as popular audio or challenges, can increase discoverability 112. Using relevant and targeted hashtags helps users searching for specific content find an account 112. Actively interacting with other accounts, including liking, commenting, and sharing, can lead to reciprocal follows 112. Cross-promoting an Instagram account on other social media platforms and websites can also drive traffic and new followers 112. Optimizing the Instagram profile with a clear bio and engaging visuals creates a positive first impression 112. Instagram's algorithm prioritizes content based on engagement, relevance to users' interests, and the recency of the post 112. In the long term, building an authentic presence and fostering genuine connections with the audience are key to sustained follower growth on Instagram 17. Maintaining a consistent branding and visual aesthetic across all content helps build brand recognition and attract followers who appreciate that style 81. Focusing on driving meaningful engagement with followers is also crucial for long-term growth, as the algorithm increasingly values interaction over mere follower count 81.

On Facebook, optimizing the page with complete and accurate information is the first step in attracting followers 26. Creating high-quality content that resonates with the target audience and encourages sharing is vital 26. Consistency in posting keeps the audience engaged and provides more opportunities for new users to discover the page 26. Actively engaging with the audience by responding to comments and messages fosters a sense of community 26. Hosting giveaways and contests can be effective in attracting new followers 26. Cross-promoting the Facebook page on other social media channels and websites can also increase its visibility 26. Facebook's algorithm prioritizes content that is engaging and authentic 28. In the long term, providing quality and valuable content, maintaining a consistent presence, and authentically interacting with the audience build trust and contribute to sustained follower growth on Facebook 29.

For Weibo, factors influencing new follows include creating posts that are well-received and engaging honestly with the community 40. Motivations for using Weibo that can lead to increased followers include professional development, emotional release, information seeking, engaging in citizenship behavior, social connection, seeking visibility, self-expression, and interacting with the platform's features 117. To continuously expand their influence on Weibo, celebrities and other users need to share valuable information, actively engage with their fans, and maintain a consistent and active presence on the platform 118.

On TikTok, knowing the target audience and tailoring content to their interests is fundamental for attracting followers 119. Jumping on trending sounds, challenges, and hashtags can significantly increase the discoverability of videos 119. Telling compelling stories through short-form video can captivate viewers and encourage them to follow 119. Examining the content strategies of competitors can provide valuable insights 119. Using relevant and specific hashtags helps the algorithm categorize content and show it to interested users 119. Creating high-quality, authentic, and relatable content is crucial for resonating with the TikTok community 120. Engaging with the audience through comments and duets fosters a sense of connection 120. TikTok's algorithm favors content that is engaging and original 62. In the long term, consistently creating valuable and entertaining content, authentically participating in trends, and building a distinct personal brand are key to achieving sustained growth on TikTok 120.

Online communities typically form around shared interests, goals, or needs 123. The initial interaction and the ability of new members to find others with similar interests play a crucial role in the early stages of formation 126. As a community develops, building trust among members, establishing shared norms and expectations for behavior, and fostering a strong sense of belonging, often referred to as a sense of virtual community (SOVC), become paramount 123. Self-disclosure, the act of revealing personal information, and the principle of reciprocity, where members reciprocate disclosures and support, are important for deepening relationships within the community 126. Research suggests that community support, where members feel valued and their contributions are recognized, and the development of effective commitment, reflecting a long-term orientation towards the community, are key drivers of user engagement 124.

However, online communities are also susceptible to decline. Several factors can contribute to this fading of user relationships, including a perceived lack of interesting people or friends remaining active in the community, a drop in the quality or relevance of content, poor usability or technical issues with the platform, experiences of harassment or bullying, the community becoming too time-consuming or isolating, a lack of trust among members, over-commercialization or excessive promotion, dissatisfaction with community moderators or leadership, and a general sense of the community becoming boring or stagnant 123. Ultimately, user attrition and a decrease in overall activity are key indicators of a community's decline 130. Long-term research on online communities has highlighted the importance of structural and cultural continuities, actively maintained by both users and administrators, for the long-term development and persistence of these social aggregations 123. Many theories propose life-cycle models for online communities, suggesting that decline and eventual demise are potential outcomes 123. It's also important to consider the different levels of engagement within a community, with some members being active posters while others are primarily lurkers, and understanding the dynamics of both groups is crucial for community health 133.

User interaction acts as a significant catalyst in the evolution of online connections. On Twitter/X, dialogue-oriented content in tweets, characterized by references to others and an open tone, is strongly linked to increased user interaction, such as likes and retweets 134. Retweets tend to be associated with messages that have popular characteristics and express positive feelings, while replies often involve more personalized content and may convey negative emotions 135. For journalists on Twitter, engaging in interactive behavior with their audience has been shown to predict higher perceptions of their credibility 136. Analyzing user interactions as weighted directed networks can provide valuable insights into group dynamics and individual connectivity 137. Research on sentiment in Weibo found that anger among users shows a higher correlation when they share more interactions, suggesting that emotions can spread more readily within closely interacting groups 138.

On Instagram, the act of sharing photos has been found to moderate the relationships between users' social connectedness, feelings of loneliness, and overall well-being 139. The platform can also play a role in facilitating the development of friendships in real life, particularly for individuals who may be more reserved or hesitant in face-to-face interactions 140. On Facebook, communication among users on the platform is associated with an increase in the reported closeness of their relationships, even when accounting for other forms of contact like in-person meetings or phone calls 141. Interestingly, research indicates that users tend to directly message only a small percentage of their total network on Facebook 142. Facebook serves as an important tool for both maintaining existing social connections and expanding users' social networks 143. An analysis of user interactions with smoking cessation content on Facebook revealed a surprising negative correlation between the "like" reaction and organic reach, while other interactions like "haha," comments, "love" reactions, and shares showed positive correlations 144.

Weibo's comment feature distinguishes it from platforms like Twitter, and research has shown that commenting is a prevalent type of interaction highly correlated with bidirectional friendships between users 145. Motivations for liking content on Weibo, such as enjoyment and seeking information, have been found to positively affect users' liking behavior 146. The level of user interaction on Weibo can also be influenced by factors like the regional economic development, with more developed areas showing higher rates of social connection and entertainment activity 147. On TikTok, the platform's algorithmic personalization has been found to predict users' feelings of social connectedness by curating identity-relevant content 148. User interactions on TikTok, such as likes, shares, and follows, provide valuable data that the platform's recommendation algorithms use to personalize content delivery 149. The real-time feedback and opportunities for user participation in discussions on TikTok contribute to its high levels of engagement 150. Furthermore, the collaboration between users and TikTok's AI-driven algorithms significantly influences both users' engagement with the platform and their social interactions within it 151.

Predicting the future evolution of user connections on social media is an active area of research, with various statistical models and algorithms being employed. In the context of Twitter/X, longitudinal studies have utilized negative binomial auto-regression models to predict the formation of new connections 11. Researchers have also developed classifiers to identify users who are likely to experience an increase in their follower count based on their profile characteristics 21. Statistical models have been used to examine the multitude of factors associated with user engagement in real-world events on Twitter, aiming to predict both the presence and the degree of engagement 152. Regression and classification models, including logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests, have been applied to investigate the factors that drive user engagement with news content shared on Twitter 153. A predictive analysis paradigm has been proposed for Twitter data, using fine-grained analysis of individual tweets (sentiment, topics, emotions) to make coarse-grained predictions about real-world events 154. Twitter's own algorithm for ranking tweets relies on neural networks with millions of parameters, continuously trained on user interactions 111. Predicting users' future interests on the platform has also been explored using models that consider the temporal evolution of user interests 156.

For Instagram, linear regression models have been used to predict audience awareness, often measured as engagement percentage 157. Machine learning regression models, including linear regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), multilayer perceptrons (neural networks), Random Forest, XGBoost, and support vector regression (SVR), have been tested to predict user popularity, which is often defined by a combination of follower growth rate and engagement rate 158. In the realm of Facebook, statistical models are employed to understand and predict the evolution of connection networks and the social processes that unfold within them 159. Regression models have also been created to predict the number of likes a Facebook post might receive based on factors like its type and reach 160.

On Weibo, a Unified Model with Heterogeneous Information (UMHI) has been developed for predicting when users will unfollow other accounts, taking into account both spatial (social network structure) and temporal (post content, unfollow history) attributes 105. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM), are being used for sentiment analysis of Weibo posts and even for predicting stock market changes based on user sentiment 161. Latent growth curve models (LGCM) and latent growth mixture models (LGMM) have been applied to analyze the trends and heterogeneity in users' subjective well-being (SWB) as expressed on Weibo over time 46. User behavior prediction on Weibo has also been approached using deep learning architectures like Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Nets (DCGAN), showing promising accuracy in forecasting different types of user actions 163. Furthermore, uncertain time series analysis has been used to model and predict the forwarding of rumors on the platform 165.

TikTok's algorithm itself is a complex predictive model that determines which content to show to users based on a vast array of signals related to user engagement, video information, and device settings 59. Predictive modeling is also being explored in the context of customer experience on TikTok, aiming to anticipate user behavior and preferences 167.

Sociological perspectives provide a broad understanding of how the internet, including social media, is reshaping social interactions, community structures, and individual identities, reflecting broader societal trends and values 168. The rise of the internet has implications for various societal domains, including inequality (the digital divide), social capital, political participation, organizations, and cultural diversity 169. Social network analysis, as a sociological tool, helps conceptualize and model society as interconnected sets of individuals or groups, linked by specific relationships 1. Several sociological theories offer frameworks for understanding relationship development within online communities, such as theories focusing on relational signals, social penetration (how relationships deepen over time), and uncertainty management (how individuals seek information to build relationships) 125.

Psychological explanations delve into the individual factors influencing online connections. Evolutionary cyber-psychology examines online behaviors through the lens of evolutionary pressures, considering aspects like mating, parenting, trust, and information management 175. Research has also explored the link between dark personality traits (narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism) and antisocial online behaviors 175. Internet addiction and its association with feelings of loneliness have been studied, with findings suggesting a complex relationship depending on usage patterns and individual demographics 176. The impact of internet use on cognitive processes, such as attention and memory, and even brain structure through neuroplasticity, is another area of investigation 177. The psychology of online relationships considers factors like anonymity, reduced social pressure, the development of trust and authenticity, and the manifestation of attachment styles in virtual interactions 178. The online disinhibition effect, where individuals feel less restrained online due to factors like anonymity and invisibility, can lead to both increased self-disclosure (benign disinhibition) and more negative behaviors like cyberbullying (toxic disinhibition) 181. Dynamic Network Theory (DNT) provides a perspective on how social networks influence individual goal pursuit and resistance processes 5, while the Relationship Maintenance Strategies Model (RMSM) examines how individuals use their social networks to maintain intimate relationships 186. Finally, psychological research suggests cognitive limits on the number of active social ties an individual can maintain, as proposed by Dunbar's number 3.

In conclusion, the evolution of user connection relationships on social media is a multifaceted phenomenon driven by a complex interplay of technological platforms, individual user behavior, and underlying social and psychological forces. Social Network Analysis provides a valuable methodological framework for mapping and quantifying these relationships, while sociological and psychological theories offer critical insights into the motivations and dynamics at play. Longitudinal studies across various platforms reveal both common trends and platform-specific nuances in how user connections form, evolve, and dissolve over time. Factors such as content quality, user engagement, algorithmic influences, and individual psychological states all contribute to the ever-changing landscape of online social networks. The increasing sophistication of predictive models and algorithms demonstrates the growing effort to forecast these dynamics, which has significant implications for businesses, researchers, and individuals navigating the digital world. Future research should continue to explore the long-term impacts of these evolving online connections on individual well-being, social structures, and societal norms.
