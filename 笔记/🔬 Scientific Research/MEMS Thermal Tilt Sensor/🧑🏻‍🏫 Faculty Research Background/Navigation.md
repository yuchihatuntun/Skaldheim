In this section, I will focus on the research directions and representative publications of university faculty members. I will start by investigating teachers from our own university (SYSU)'s relevant schools, and may later update with information on faculty members from other universities.

### SYSU School of Information Science and Technology Overview

##### School of Integrated Circuits

The School of Integrated Circuits of Sun Yat-sen University was established in February 2021. It is one of the first colleges to respond to the national strategy of establishing the first-level discipline of "Integrated Circuit Science and Engineering". It is located in the Shenzhen Campus of Sun Yat-sen University and is a secondary college of the university.
