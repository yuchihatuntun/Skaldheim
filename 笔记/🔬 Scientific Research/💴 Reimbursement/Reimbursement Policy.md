Experimental material procurement is divided into three categories: 
- the first category is **online procurement**, 

- the second category is **offline procurement**, 

- the third category is **offline small-amount registration**.

**Online procurement** <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(254, 118, 120)">(easier and better)</span>: Procure in [the procurement mall of the school's experimental material procurement platform](https://www.rjmart.cn/). When placing an order, a fund number needs to be filled in. There is no need to pay in advance by oneself. The supplier will settle with the school's finance department uniformly.

**Offline procurement** (pay by oneself, on platforms such as JD.com and Taobao, order amount is greater than or equal to 1000): Before procurement, first enter a procurement intention application on the experimental material procurement platform. Procurement can be implemented only after approval. If the approval is not passed, procurement cannot be carried out! (Note that items with a unit price greater than or equal to 1000 may not be classified as experimental materials. They may be counted as fixed assets. At this time, online competitive bidding procurement is required).

**Offline small-amount registration** <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(254, 118, 120)">(mainly)</span>: (pay by oneself, on platforms such as JD.com and Taobao) Applicable to the procurement of experimental materials with an order amount of less than 1000 yuan. For the same payee account, the single cumulative order amount cannot reach 1000 yuan.
