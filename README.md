# Skaldheim: Open Source Knowledge Base for Exam Preparation

Welcome to the **Skaldheim**, a collaborative platform designed to help students, especially those in the School of Microelectronics Science and Technology, prepare for their exams efficiently. Created by the Class of 2023, this project aims to centralize high-quality study materials and foster a community of knowledge sharing.

## üéØ **Positioning and Objectives**

This knowledge base was initiated by students from the Class of 2023 at the School of Microelectronics Science and Technology. While it naturally focuses on providing exam preparation materials for microelectronics and related fields, we warmly welcome students from other disciplines to contribute and benefit from this platform.

The primary goal is to address the challenges faced by sophomore and junior students in preparing for specialized courses. Many students struggle with the scarcity of reliable study materials, which are often scattered and inconsistent. Our platform aims to centralize and curate these resources, offering a comprehensive and accessible repository of course notes, past exam papers, key concept summaries, and more.

By fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing, we hope to create a supportive community where students can find the tools they need to excel in their studies.
